<h2>Administrator Help</h2>
<hr>
<p dir="ltr">This document tries to provide the information necessary
for an individual to run the JVCL project. The purpose of this document
is to ease the way for new admins and to remind current admins about
the tasks might they have to perform to make things in JVCL run
smoothly and also to remind them on how these tasks are most easily
performed. </p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Additionally, this document lists common practices used
today within the JVCL to complete these tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All passwords and sensitive URLs are passed from one admin to the
next via private, secured channels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What do admins do?</h4>
<p>Here's some of the more common tasks an admin might perform:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keeps the big picture in mind and makes sure the general
direction of the project is sound.</li>
  <li>Adds and removes developers from the project.</li>
  <li>Has the final say on what to add and what to remove from the
sources.</li>
  <li>Handles official communications with other parties.</li>
  <li>Makes sure the web site is maintained and up to date.</li>
  <li>Makes sure that new releases are available.</li>
  <li>Jumps in and solves problems noone else is interested in.</li>
  <li>If a member of JEDI Steering, tries to promote and speak for the
project.</li>
  <li>Communicates with the team members in private if needed (or
wanted), trying to keep the team happy and content.</li>
  <li>Tries to help solve issues between developers within the team as
well as issues with people outside the team.</li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">Promotes the project whenever and however he can.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">The web site</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The web site is currently hosted on a Borland server. The
server location and username/password needed to upload files are only
available to admins. The website files are available in CVS (currently
in dev/website/JVCL3) and should match the content on the home page.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">&nbsp;</h4>
<h4 dir="ltr">The project space</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Sourceforge provides us with space on their servers as
well. The project can be accessed using SSH Secure Shell (<a
 href="http://www.ssh.com">http://www.ssh.com</a>) using the following
settings:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Hostname</th>
      <td>jvcl.sourceforge.net </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Port</th>
      <td>22</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Username</th>
      <td>&lt;your sourceforge username&gt;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp; </p>
<p dir="ltr">The project web space currently contains the script to
create the daily zips, a redirect to the new site URL, a copy of the
active CVS (used by the daily zip script), a redirection to the current
location of Mantis and some help related zip files. </p>
<h4 dir="ltr">&nbsp;</h4>
<h4 dir="ltr">The daily files</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The daily zip files at <a href="http://jvcl.sf.net/daily">http://jvcl.sf.net/daily</a>
are generated by a shell script in the sourceforge project web space
(see above). The current script is located in
/home/groups/j/jv/jvcl/bin and is named postnew.sh. The zip files are
created automatically by a crontab job running once a day. When an
admin takes over the script maintenance, he also needs to install it in
his own crontab to make sure it runs. For more info on crontab and how
to use it, see the man page in Linux.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">&nbsp;</h4>
<h4 dir="ltr">Managing developers</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Admins handles adding and removing developers as well as
handling their permissions to various parts of the project. An admin
should make sure that the people having developer status also are
reasonably active within the project. If it is discovered or suspected
that a developer is doing something dangerous or detrimental to the
JVCL project (like removing files or making strange changes), he should
be removed <i>immediately</i>. A discussion with the developer can
then be initiated and, if a resolution is found, the developer can
maybe be added again.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">&nbsp;</h4>
<h4 dir="ltr">The CVS repository</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The CVS repository can be access by anyone having
developer access. An admins main responsibility in CVS is to add and
remove folder structures when needed and generally keep CVS
clean.&nbsp; Problems with CVS that cannot be resolved by the admin,
should be reported to SF for resolution (stale locks, file recasing,
folder deletion etc).</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">&nbsp;</h4>
<h4 dir="ltr">Preparing releases</h4>
<p>One of the most important tasks for an admin is making sure the
releases are created and uploaded. In JVCL3, the release mechanism has
been greatly simplified thanks to the use of want (a commandline script
tool). </p>
<p>To prepare and create a release, an admin needs to perform the
following tasks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Check out a clean copy of JCL and JVCL and test the installation
on all available Delphi/BCB/Kylix versions.</li>
  <li>Check that all examples compiles.</li>
  <li>Once the installation is verified to work, branch the CVS
repository. The branch should be on the form
JVCL&lt;ALPHA|BETA|GAMMA|RELEASE|FINAL&gt;&lt;version&gt;. Should any
last minute update come in, add them to the HEAD and the Branch.
Creating a branch allows developers to continue their work without
impacting on the admin preparation work.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Obtain a fresh copy of the help file from the Help Coordinator.</li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">Run the want script in dev/JVCL3/install/release from
a command
prompt to create the releases. To see available options, use "want
help" and follow indications in readme.txt.</p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">Once the zip files have been created, upload them to
sourceforge's ftp folder (/ incoming).</p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">Go to the sf project page, log in as an admin and
create a new release in the release system.</p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">Add the uploaded files to the release as required.</p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">Post update announcements to all mailing lists,
newsgroups and magazines as listed in
dev/JVCL3/install/release/announce.txt (and any others you can come up
with). </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp; </p>
<h4 dir="ltr">The bug tracker</h4>
<p>Admins should have admin access to the bug tracker (contact one of
the current Mantis admins if you are a JVCL admin and don't have admin
access to Mantis). As an admin, you should clean up the users list from
time to time and also close old bugs that are either resolved or have
been inactive for a long time. </p>
<h4 dir="ltr">&nbsp;</h4>
<h4 dir="ltr">JEDI Steering</h4>
<p>An admin that is also a member of JEDI Steering, should participate
in the discussions on the JEDI Steering mailing list as much as needed.
JEDI Steering is, despite it's name, not steering the JVCL or any other
JEDI project. Instead, Steering is a forum for JEDI project admins to
discuss and decide on matters that affects all JEDI groups. Active JEDI
projects should have at least one representative in JEDI Steering.</p>
