            <P>This document is "inherited" from similar work done by the 
            members of CompuServe Nantucket Forum (NANFORUM) for Clipper, and we 
            would like to acknowledge it gratefully here.</P>

      <h5>
      <A name=history>1.1 History</A></h5>
            <P>When Project JEDI ("Joint Endeavor of Delphi Innovators) was 
            formed in 1997 to translate API headers into Delphi, it was 
            envisaged that component writing - especially wrappers for the API 
            calls that are surfaced to Delphi through the translations - would 
            eventually become a project activity.&nbsp;
            <P>&nbsp;
            <P> In our recent reassertion of 
            the project's goals we confirmed that intention and expanded it to 
            encompass the general world of free components. Project JEDI intends 
            to work with Borland R &amp; D and its Code Central repository 
            project, as well as other developers and collectors of freeware 
            components, to bring this work into easy reach of all Delphi 
            developers. 
            <h5><A name=trademarks>1.2 Trademarks</A> 
      </h5>
            <P>Delphi is a registered trademark of Inprise Corporation. Inprise 
            Corporation will be referred to as Borland throughout this document. 

            <h5><A name=borland3p>1.3 Relationship to Borland and third party</A> 

      </h5>

            <P>JEDI-VCL is a project independent of any third party developer or 
            Borland. There is no official "sanction" or "seal of approval" from 
            Borland. Any decision to accept and include a component into the 
            JEDI-VCL components will be made without regard to the existence of 
            components performing similar functions in any commercial or 
            non-commercial third party or Borland product, provided no copyright 
            or patent restrictions are violated. 

            <P>&nbsp; 
            <P>The intention is not that JEDI-VCL should compete with third 
            party products but, rather, that it fill in the holes in Borland 
            Delphi's standard VCL library. Since overlaps of functionality 
            already occur between other third-party libraries, it is considered 
            impracticable to try to avoid them in our own considerations. 
            <P>&nbsp; 
            <P>Developers submitting JEDI-VCL components may be corporate 
            developers, third party developers, independent 
            consultant/programmers, hobbyists or any other people developing in 
            Delphi. Perhaps even Borland employees will contribute. No 
            individual is precluded from contributing on the basis of a 
            particular affiliation. 
            <P>&nbsp; 
            <P>If Borland employees submit components, they would do so as 
            individuals, with no implication made nor inference drawn that 
            Borland was either involved in the project or is committed to 
            supporting the public domain library. 
            <P>Borland is permitted and encouraged to include free of charge any 
            of the JEDI-VCL components in future releases of Delphi. 
            <h5><A name=delphiversions>1.4 Borland Delphi versions supported</A> 
      </h5>
            <P><b><font color="#800000">[TODO: change this to reflect current
            status]</font></b> 
            <P>JEDI-VCL components will be designed to work with the version of 
            Borland Delphi which is current at the time of release, as well as 
            the previous one if that is technically possible. For example, at 
            the time of this writing (September 1999) Delphi 5 (current) and 
            Delphi 4 (previous) would be supported. Many of the components will 
            be compatible with earlier versions of Borland Delphi. However, 
            ensuring compatibility will be the responsibility of the user. A 
            user wanting a component to work with other versions of Borland 
            Delphi will have to make the necessary modifications to the source 
            code. Nevertheless, a component's developer may choose to include 
            compiler switches to provide compatibility with earlier versions, at 
            his/her discretion. If support for prior versions is claimed, it 
            will be tested and validated by Project JEDI. 
            <P>&nbsp; 
            <P>Components published in the JEDI-VCL should work in the current 
            retail release of Delphi. In cases where a component author does not 
            have access to the current product release, Project JEDI will try to 
            assist by arranging for testing by other members who have the 
            current product release. 
            <P>&nbsp; 
            <P>Project JEDI will provide on the Web an overview showing what 
            product versions a published component was explicitly tested with. 
            When a new Delphi version is released, this overview will be updated 
            as the components are tested and verified against the new release. 
            <P>Code needs periodic maintenance to stay "current" - it may still 
            compile five versions later, but may not have kept up with evolving 
            UI or coding style. 
            <h5><A name=newusers>1.5 Queries from new users</A> 
      </h5>
            <P>Queries from new users interested in finding out about the 
            JEDI-VCL should be handled in a uniform and courteous way. An 
            information page will be created on this web site to explain what 
            the JEDI-VCL is and how to contact the people currently maintaining 
            it. A text message can be sent in response to any query.</P>

            <P>JEDI-VCL will be provided in separate functional packages. To 
            ensure future compatibility, users of these packages will be 
            required to distribute only the official JEDI released packages. 
            This does not preclude developers from building their own packages 
            from the individual components.<BR>

            <P>If a need for a new component has been identified, Project JEDI 
            will place a RFP on the Web site, and send email to JEDI members. In 
            cases where a member identifies a need and submits a ready

      </h5>
            <P>In the event that more than one developer submits components or 
            packages that perform substantially the same services, referees will 
            evaluate the alternatives according to their power, functionality, 
            flexibility, and ease of use and choose the one to be included. 
            Because of the cooperative, non-commercial nature of the library, no 
            contributor should feel offended when duplicate components need to 
            be excluded. 
            <P>When benefit is perceived from merging two substantially similar 
            components or packages to enhance functionality, the referees (see 
            paragraph 6.3) may exercise their prerogative to do so. The authors 
            would be closely involved in the process and the referees may choose 
            to a Request for Comments (RFC) to gain additional information from 
            the community and ensure a better design. 
            <h5><A name=license>3.3 Legal License</A> 
      </h5>
            <P>Each author submitting source code must include as part of that 
            code a statement that the work is original and that he or she is 
            placing the code into the public domain, or releasing it under the 
            MPL (see 5.1.1 and 5.1.2). The librarian (see paragraph 7.1) and 
            referees should make a reasonable effort to ensure that no copyright 
            source code, such as that supplied with some third party libraries, 
            finds its way into the JEDI-VCL. However, under no circumstances 
            will the librarian, referees, or any other party other than the 
            submitter be responsible for copyright code that appears in the 
            library accidentally. 
            <h5><A name=sourcecode>3.4 Source code</A></h5>
            <P>The author must provide full source code for every routine to be 
            included in JEDI-VCL. No routine will be considered for inclusion in 
            the library if only compiled code (DCU/BPL) is submitted.

            <P>Librarians and referees shall not be expected to repair 
            inconsistencies in documentation format, component naming, and other 
            requirements. Source code which does not arrive in proper format 
            will not be considered.

            <P>Please note: we need separate registration units for individual 
            components, as well as for packages, to allow users the choice of 
            using the package provided by Project JEDI, or incorporating 
            individual components into their private packages. 
            <h5><A name=quality>3.6 Quality and perceived usefulness</A> 
      </h5>
            <P>In a cooperative effort like this, it will be difficult to 
            enforce some standard of quality and/or usefulness. For example, a 
            component to handle the military's "Zulu time" may be very useful to 
            some, and unnecessary to others. 
            <P>&nbsp; 
            <P>By virtue of its origins, the JEDI-VCL will be a mixture of some 
            components of very high quality and others perhaps not as fine. It 
            is up to the users to improve it. It will be complete in some areas 
            and quite sparse in others. It is up to the users to fill in the 
            holes. 
            <P>&nbsp; 
            <P>We shall err on the side of including "questionable" components, 
            provided they seem to work. Debates on the quality of the library's 
            source code will be encouraged and will take place in the proper 
            message section of the JEDI-VCL Mailing list.</P>

            this project and the complexity involved in coordinating testing,

            <P>As the library and associated documentation are updated, simple 
            announcements will be posted on the Project JEDI home page, Delphi 
            newsgroups and the JEDI mailing list. These are the only places 
            where updates will be announced. An update announcement indicates 
            that it is immediately available for downloading from 
            ftp://delphi-jedi.org and through links on the JEDI Web site. 
            <h5><A name=bugreports>4.5 Bug reports and fixes</A>

            <P>The librarian will correlate and verify all bug reports, with the 
            help of the referees. If the referees believe a bug to be serious, 
            they will arrange to have it fixed and the librarian will release a 
            maintenance upgrade immediately it is ready. If they consider it a 
            minor bug, it will be fixed but not installed for release until the 
            next scheduled upgrade. Such bug fixes may be released as "patches."

            to this scheme: <b> Patch X for JEDI XXX Library n for Delphi v.ZIP</b>,
            where &lt;X&gt; is a number starting from 1. Patches will be 
            numbered sequentially. Patches will be deleted every time a new

            particular mailing list or newsgroup, and anyone who knows the answer should 
            respond. No one is obliged to answer, but it is considered good form 
            to respond with something, even if one doesn't know the answer.<P>&nbsp; 
            <P>Support will include help on recompiling the components or

            <P>In order to assist users of Borland C++Builder, JEDI-VCL may need 
            to be tested with the current release of C++Builder, and modified as 
            needed. This should be done by a dedicated team with C++Builder 
            knowledge before any release of JEDI-VCL.</P>

      <p>The purpose of this standard is to create

      <p>However, it is extremely important that anyone submitting code

      <p>The "XXX.PAS" in the Original Code above 
            shall contain the source file name. This often differs from the 
            individual component name. For example, a component named TJvScreen 
            would be included in SCREEN.PAS. As a rule, source files (.PAS) 
            should not have the "TJv" or "Jv" prefixes.

      <h5>
      <A name=assertions>5.1.5 Assertions</A> 
      </h5>
            <P>It is a good coding technique to include Assertions within your 
            source code (short pre-condition and post-condition routines with 
            your component procedures/functions), which will be useful to end 
            users to understand the assumptions of the component's author. They 
            will be invoked only during an execution from within Delphi IDE, but 
            not compiled into the final version, so there is no penalty in using 
            them. 
            <h5><A name=names>5.2 Component names</A> 
      </h5>
            <P>All JEDI-VCL components will use the standard 'TJv' prefix to 
            distinguish them from other components (Please note: "J" is 
            capitalized). TJv has been registered to Project JEDI in the Delphi 
            Prefix Registry ('DPR') at <A 
            href="http://www.delphiprefixregistry.net/">http://www.delphiprefixregistry.net/</A>&nbsp; 

            <h5><A name=authority>5.3 Librarian's authority to change component 
            names</A> 
      </h5>
            <P>Some components will be submitted bearing either (1) a similar 
            name to another component in the library or (2) an inappropriate 
            name or prefix. For example, a component called TJvPrint that writes 
            a character to the screen could be said to be named inappropriately, 
            as it implies some relationship to a printer. The librarian shall 
            have the responsibility to rename submitted components to improve 
            clarity or permit uniqueness. 
            <h5><A name=changing>5.3.1 Changing a component name after it has 
            been released</A> 
      </h5>
            <P>Once a particular component is included in a library release, its 
            name should be frozen. To allow renaming would probably raise 
            problems for users who had used the previous name and were not 
            tracking the changes to the library. 
            <h5><A name=formatting>5.4 Source code formatting</A> 
      </h5>
            <P>Borland Delphi code shall be formatted in accordance with 
            standard currently defined by Borland for the Delphi VCL. As stated 
            above, at present we will follow the <A 
            href="http://community.borland.com/soapbox/techvoyage/article/1,1795,10280,00.html">Delphi 
            Style Guide</A>, as published by Charlie Calvert. The general goal is to provide a consistent format that is 
            recognized by all Borland Delphi developers. Deviations should be avoided. 
            <P>&nbsp; 
            <P>You can use following tools to assist you with code formatting:

      </h5>
            <UL>
              <LI>Space characters: place one space after a comma or colon 
              symbol and place one space each side of an operator symbol ( +, -, 
              *, /, := , = , &lt;, &gt;, etc.) </LI></UL>
            <UL>
              <LI>No more than one command or variable declaration on one source 
              line. </LI></UL>
            <UL>
              <LI>If there is no method description then at least a separating 
              line (e.g. //------ to a width of 80 characters) should be placed 
              between methods. Often it is unnecessary to include an individual 
              description for each method, e.g. a method named CountErrors would 
              not require a description. </LI></UL>
            <UL>
              <LI>Use parentheses to increase readability of complex Boolean or 
              mathematical expressions, even where the rules of precedence for 
              evaluation would permit them to be optionally omitted. </LI></UL>
            <UL>
              <LI>Minimize the use of functions in Boolean expressions or other 
              situations where side effects might be difficult to trace.
              <LI>Explicit dereferencing (like in MyDynamicArray^[0]) is no 
              longer necessary and should be avoided wherever possible. </LI></UL>
            <UL>
              <LI>Structure function implementations so that they end at only 
              one point (its end keyword) and are not terminated by Exit (if 
              possible). </LI></UL>
            <UL>
              <LI>Labels with absolute jumps are considered bad programming 
              style (exception: assembler). </LI></UL>

      </h5>
            <P>We encourage use of Composition by utilizing Interfaces and 
            delegating tasks to other objects. Inheritance should be used mainly 
            for extending properties and methods in a "Is-a-Kind-of" 
            relationships. 
            <h5><A name=inheritance>6.1.2 Inheritance</A> 
      </h5>
            <P>The final component (TJvMyComponent) should descend from at least 
            one custom component (TJvMyCustomComponent). 
            <h5><A name=scope>6.1.3 Method Scope</A> 
      </h5>
            <P>Protected and Virtual methods are preferred for JEDI components. 
            Defining a method as Private is discouraged, unless consciously 
            applied for a reason. 
            <h5><A name=private>6.1.4 Private Fields/Variables</A> 
      </h5>
            <P>All 'Private' Fields/Variables should have associated Get and 
            (where it makes sense) Set 'Protected' methods. This allows easy 
            access to them in descendants, if required. 
            <h5><A name=asm>6.1.5 ASM</A> 
      </h5>
            <P>Assembler routines (ASM) are acceptable only for machine-level 
            glue logic that cannot be performed by high-level Pascal source 
            code. We will require source code comments to explain why 
            machine-level glue logic is required at all. Any author considering 
            submitting ASM code should seek advice on the mailing 
            list/newsgroups for an Object Pascal solution, before committing to 
            writing ASM code. 
            <P>ASM for the sole purpose of performance is prohibited except in 
            extreme cases, and even then should be accompanied by functionally 
            equivalent Pascal source in comments. See math.pas for examples. 
            <h5><A name=reference>6.1.6 Reference to Design-time Units in RunTime 
            Code</A> 
      </h5>
            <P>Please DO NOT refer in your RunTime code to DsgnIntf, LibIntf, or 
            any other design-time code. Starting with Delphi 6 separation of 
            design time code from runtime code became mandatory.&nbsp; 
            <h5><A name=ifdef>6.1.7 Usage of $IFDEF Conditional Compiler 
            Directives</A> 
      </h5>
            <P><b><font color="#800000">[TODO: change this to reflect current
            status]</font></b> 
            <P>Since we will be supporting only two consecutive releases of 
            Delphi, there should be no need to use $IFDEF directives. They make 
            code maintenance and readability difficult. Please DO NOT use them, 
            unless you can make a case to demonstrate that they are absolutely 
            required.<BR>
            <P>Project JEDI will provide a standard file containing conditional 
            directives.

      </h5>
            <P><b><font color="#800000">[TODO: change this to reflect current
            status]</font></b> 
            <P>Events should be fired via overrideable methods, and the 
            component's implementation should call through such methods 
            exclusively (don't fire the event property directly). All calls to 
            component events should be directed via a virtual/dynamic method. If 
            the method is not expected to be overridden frequently by 
            descendents, the method should be declared dynamic to save on VMT 
            space. The performance difference between dynamic and virtual is 
            negligible for user-initiated events.<BR>

            same .DPK file. If there is some reason to split the .PAS, the

            any conflicts between packages. The JEDI-VCL will follow the model 
            established by the TurboPower® scheme: 
            <P>&nbsp; <PRE>PNNNMKVV.*
||  |||
||  ||+------ VV  VCL version (30=Delphi 3, 35=C++Builder 3,40=Delphi 4)
||  |+------- K   Kind of package (R=runtime, D=designtime, T-trialrun)
||  +-------- M   Product specific modifier (Underscore=default)
|+----------- NNN Product version number (e.g., 201=version 2.01)
+------------ P   Package name

</PRE> <p>For example, an Internet design package Version 1.0 for Delphi 5 would
      be:<br>
      <br>
  </p> <PRE>   JvInternet100_D50.BPL

</PRE> <p>The same package, but a Runtime version, would be:<br>
      <br>
  </p> <PRE>   JvInternet100_R50.BPL  </PRE> <PRE>&nbsp;</PRE>In order to allow usage of packages, 
            as well as building "private" packages from individual components, 
            we will "multi-registering unit" for all components, as well as 
            "registration unit" for each component (if justified). 
            <P>Below you can see a typical structure of JEDI-VCL packages:

            <P>Please use this structure, so we can achieve a consistency across 
            JVCL components and simplify maintenance. We will just add your 
            Registration/Resource units, and your RunTime package to the JVCL 
            Design package, and we are in business :)

            <P>&nbsp; 
            <P>JEDI-VCL can make no assumptions about the end user's capability 
            to link in any library other than the Delphi Standard version of 
            VCL. Therefore, no component will be added to JEDI-VCL that requires 
            any other third party component library, unless it is freely 
            available on the Web (e.g. RxLib). There might be, however, 
            subsections of JEDI-VCL requiring Pro and C/S versions of Delphi 
            VCL. 
            <P>Our general preferences are: 
            <P>1) Don't use any 3rd Party libs 
            <P>2) Copy code from 3rd Party libs (with permission and by giving 
            Credit) - this prevents future "update" incompatibles 
            <P>3) Make all 3rd Party libs used in a tested version available for 
            download on JEDI-VCL Site (they should not be included in JEDI-VCL 
            libs)<BR>
            <P>The 3rd Party functions/components should be placed in a separate 
            package.<BR>
            <P>JEDI will attempt to record accurately and associate the 
            version/build data of 3rd party libs with specific builds of the 
            TJv's that use them. It is essential that authors include this 
            information when submitting their source code.<BR>
            <h5><A name=demo>6.5 Demo Project</A> 
      </h5>
            <P>While a Demo Project is an optional part of the submitted 
            component, the author is encouraged to include a short Demo with the 
            code. Authors should seriously consider adding it, as it may become 
            a requirement in a future version of the JEDI-VCL. 
            <h5><A name=helpfile>6.6 Help File</A> 
      </h5>
            <P>We strongly 
            encourage providing a detailed Help file with each component in a 
            text format. This will help to keep the comments in code to a needed 
            minimum. Specifically: &nbsp;</P>
            <P> </P>
            <UL>
              <LI>
              <P>All
              details on how to use the component should be in a help file 
              </P>
              <LI>
              <P>Each 
              method should be documented together with a “what it does” 
              description. </P></LI></UL>
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
            <P>We are using “Doc-O-Matic” Help creation tool 
            donated to JEDI by ToolsFactory (<A 
            href="http://www.toolsfactory.com/">http://www.toolsfactory.com/</A>).&nbsp; 
            In order to make it easy to include your file in the overall Help 
            system, the file should have description for the all classes, and 
            for all major fields, properties, events, and methods, following the 
            format below (example for JvPanel). The elements to be filled are in 
            bold. Please also note the required “@@” in the front of each of the

            <P>Peter Mugaas recommended to use the Borland resource-compiler 
            (BRCC32) which is included in Borland Delphi. The .RC file is a 
            resource script containing information about the bitmaps (see 
            example below): 
            <P>&nbsp;

            <P>Notice the links to the BMP files. These should be in the same 
            directory as the .RC file (i.e. \Source\Resource). Please use the
