<p><b>September 2004:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li> The <a target="_blank"
 href="http://homepages.borland.com/jedi/jedihelp/">Jedi Online Help</a>
system is officially launched. We hereby invite users to come and give
us a hand by documenting sections of the JVCL that they know and use
everyday. The JVCL is a collaborative work and one of the way to show
us your appreciation is by helping us making it even better.
Contributing to the online help is one of the easiest way to do this,
all you need is an Internet browser and connection.<br>

</ul>
<p><b>August 2004:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li> Peter Thörnqvist has decided to retire as JVCL Coordinator and
the new coordinator is Olivier Sannier (OBones). Andreas Hausladen is
the deputy coordinator, should Olivier be unreachable or the workload
too hard.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>April 2004:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Raymond Alexander donates a set of EDI components to JVCL. The
components are built on top of the EDI classes in JCL (also written by
Ray). A comprehensive demo that uses either Advantage or Interbase is
included as well.</li>
  <li>Added painter support to TJvPageControl and TJvTabControl. With
painters, it is easier to add custom drawing to the tabs of a page or
tab control. Also added a default painter (TJvTabDefaultPainter) with
support for gradients, different fonts for the different states
(Active, Inactive, Disabled) and support for image placement.</li>
  <li>The number of open bug reports is at an all time low. Only 5
reports that are marked as major or above are currently unresolved.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>March 2004:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>JvDesktopAlert added to the JvDlgs package. JvDesktopAlert is an
implementation of the desktop alert as seen in Outlook 2003 and can be
described as a unobtrusive notification window.</li>
  <li>JvComputerInfoEx added to the JVCL (in the JvSystem package).
JvComputerInfoEx provides detailed information about nearly every
aspect of the computer. It is mainly built on the functions in JCL
dealing with system information and the shell. This component replaces
several others, so TJvDeviceChanged, TJvSystemColors, TJvKeyboardStates
and&nbsp; TJvDirectories has been moved to archive.</li>
  <li>Andreas Hausladen is working on a new build system and a wizard
based installer. Looks promising!</li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">Added the Jv Navigation Pane components to the
JvPageComps package. These components emulates the new Nav Pane control
introduced in Outlook 2003. Along with the Nav Pane itself, the set
also includes a gradient header, two type of buttons and two types of
splitters as well as a style manager.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Added TJvColorTrackBar from Stefano Pessina to JvMM.</li>
  <li>Added TJvDBFindEdit to JvDB and TJvDotNetDBFindEdit to
JvDotNetCtrls from yul.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>February 2004:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>A beta release of JVCL 3 has been posted to sourceforge on
february 20 (<a href="Downloads.htm">download</a>). Since this is a
beta, it is very possible that it contains bugs, so please help us make
the JVCL better by reporting any findings to our <a target="_blank"
 href="ReportBug.htm"> bugtracker</a>. </li>
  <li>Added TJvOfficeColorButton, TJvOfficeColorPanel and
TJvNetscapeSplitter from dejoy. A really cool set of Office style
components partly built on the existing TJvColorButton.</li>
  <li>Added TJvDBSearchEdit and TJvDBSearchComboBox from Lionel Reynaud.</li>
  <li>Added TJvAppDBStorage, a storage implementation that can save to
a database.</li>
  <li>Added TJvWizardRouteMapList, a route map for TJvWizard that
displays the pages as a list.</li>
  <li>The web site has been redesigned to provide a clearer, more
logical and faster loading experience. The pages are not 100% complete,
so if you find any issues, <a href="Contact.htm">let us know</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>January 2004:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>DockPresident components developed by Lu Xioban have been added
to the JVCL. DockPresident (renamed to JVCL Docking), is a fabulous
library of docking components that allows developer to add docking
support to their applications with virtually no code. There are several
docking styles supported: Standard Delphi, Visual C++, Visual InterDev
and the autohiding docking forms of Visual Studio.Net. New docking
styles can relatively easy be added by deriving new docking components
from the base classes.</li>
  <li>The Delphi eXperience II and Delphi eXperience DotNet components
developed by Marc Hoffman now have been added to the JVCL.&nbsp;Delphi
eXperience II (renamed to Jv XP Controls) is a set of visual components
that have a distinct XP/Office XP and include standard controls, like
buttons and checkboxes as well as a very nice XP style navigation bar
component. Delphi eXperience DotNet (renamed to Jv DotNet Controls) is
a set of standard controls with a visual look similar to the hot
tracking style of the VS.Net components. This package includes standard
as well as DB enabled controls.</li>
