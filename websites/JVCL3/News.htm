        to come and give us a hand by documenting sections of the JVCL
        that they know and use everyday. The JVCL is a collaborative
        work and one of the way to show us your appreciation is by
        helping us making it even better. Contributing to the online
        help is one of the easiest way to do this, all you need is an
        Internet browser and connection.</li>

      <li> Peter Thörnqvist has decided to retire as JVCL Coordinator
        and the new coordinator is Olivier Sannier (OBones). Andreas
        Hausladen is the deputy coordinator, should Olivier be
        unreachable or the workload too hard.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>April 2004:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Raymond Alexander donates a set of EDI components to JVCL. The
        components are built on top of the EDI classes in JCL (also
        written by Ray). A comprehensive demo that uses either Advantage
        or Interbase is included as well.</li>
      <li>Added painter support to TJvPageControl and TJvTabControl.
        With painters, it is easier to add custom drawing to the tabs of
        a page or tab control. Also added a default painter
        (TJvTabDefaultPainter) with support for gradients, different
        fonts for the different states (Active, Inactive, Disabled) and
        support for image placement.</li>
      <li>The number of open bug reports is at an all time low. Only 5
        reports that are marked as major or above are currently
        unresolved.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>March 2004:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>JvDesktopAlert added to the JvDlgs package. JvDesktopAlert is
        an implementation of the desktop alert as seen in Outlook 2003
        and can be described as a unobtrusive notification window.</li>
      <li>JvComputerInfoEx added to the JVCL (in the JvSystem package).
        JvComputerInfoEx provides detailed information about nearly
        every aspect of the computer. It is mainly built on the
        functions in JCL dealing with system information and the shell.
        This component replaces several others, so TJvDeviceChanged,
        TJvSystemColors, TJvKeyboardStates and&nbsp; TJvDirectories has
        been moved to archive.</li>
      <li>Andreas Hausladen is working on a new build system and a
        wizard based installer. Looks promising!</li>
      <li dir="ltr">
        <p dir="ltr">Added the Jv Navigation Pane components to the
          JvPageComps package. These components emulates the new Nav
          Pane control introduced in Outlook 2003. Along with the Nav
          Pane itself, the set also includes a gradient header, two type
          of buttons and two types of splitters as well as a style
          manager.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Added TJvColorTrackBar from Stefano Pessina to JvMM.</li>
      <li>Added TJvDBFindEdit to JvDB and TJvDotNetDBFindEdit to

    <p><b>February 2004:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>A beta release of JVCL 3 has been posted to sourceforge on
        february 20 (<a href="Downloads.htm">download</a>). Since this
        is a beta, it is very possible that it contains bugs, so please
        help us make the JVCL better by reporting any findings to our <a
          target="_blank" href="ReportBug.htm"> bugtracker</a>. </li>
      <li>Added TJvOfficeColorButton, TJvOfficeColorPanel and
        TJvNetscapeSplitter from dejoy. A really cool set of Office
        style components partly built on the existing TJvColorButton.</li>
      <li>Added TJvDBSearchEdit and TJvDBSearchComboBox from Lionel
        Reynaud.</li>
      <li>Added TJvAppDBStorage, a storage implementation that can save
        to a database.</li>
      <li>Added TJvWizardRouteMapList, a route map for TJvWizard that
        displays the pages as a list.</li>
      <li>The web site has been redesigned to provide a clearer, more
        logical and faster loading experience. The pages are not 100%
        complete, so if you find any issues, <a href="Contact.htm">let
          us know</a>.</li>

    <p><b>January 2004:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>DockPresident components developed by Lu Xioban have been
        added to the JVCL. DockPresident (renamed to JVCL Docking), is a
        fabulous library of docking components that allows developer to
        add docking support to their applications with virtually no
        code. There are several docking styles supported: Standard
        Delphi, Visual C++, Visual InterDev and the autohiding docking
        forms of Visual Studio.Net. New docking styles can relatively
        easy be added by deriving new docking components from the base
        classes.</li>
      <li>The Delphi eXperience II and Delphi eXperience DotNet
        components developed by Marc Hoffman now have been added to the
        JVCL.&nbsp;Delphi eXperience II (renamed to Jv XP Controls) is a
        set of visual components that have a distinct XP/Office XP and
        include standard controls, like buttons and checkboxes as well
        as a very nice XP style navigation bar component. Delphi
        eXperience DotNet (renamed to Jv DotNet Controls) is a set of
        standard controls with a visual look similar to the hot tracking
        style of the VS.Net components. This package includes standard
        as well as DB enabled controls.</li>
