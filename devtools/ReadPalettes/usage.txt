This package spies on various IDE functions to create lists.

The JVCL needs to be installed already.
1. Install this design time only package.
2. While still in the IDE open "DXXX Packages.bpg" from the Packages directory.
3. Perform a "Build all Projects" on it.
4. While still in the IDE uninstall this package (named 'IDE tool to create the list of all installed JVCL components').
5. You will get a series of save dialogs for the various CSV files generated.
