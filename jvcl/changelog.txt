    OnEnter -> OnMouseEnter
    OnExit -> OnMouseLeave
  // peter3
2003-07-28:
- Removed JVCL components from (mainly) design-time forms to minimize inter-package dependencies. When writing 
  property editors for components in the future, please try to keep the number of JVCL components used as low
  as is absolutely possible (TODO: put this in the docs as well).
  // peter3

2003-07-25:
- TJvThreadTimer
  * rewritten by Ivo Bauer to enable resetting the thread and handle exceptions better // ivobauer

- Renamed TJvImageDlg to TJvImageDialog // peter3
- Changed UIBJVCL to USEJVCL to accomodate KWizard. When defined, JvUIB and JvWizard are installed in "JVCL" mode, i.e using TJvComponent or similar as the base class for the main component thus enabling the JVCL About box // peter3 

2003-06-29:
- Added TJvAVICapture component from Olivier Sannier // peter3

2003-06-26:
- Removed JvAutoSave and JvRegAutoSave. From now on, use JvFormStorage instead. // peter3

2003-06-23:
- Readded old TJvGradientCaption as TJvGradientHeaderPanel. Unit renamed from JvGradientCaption.pas to JvGradientHeaderPanel.pas // peter3
- Added JvDBGroupPanel.pas from Steve Paris // peter3
- Removed unnecessary IFDEF's (WIN32, COMPILER3_UP, COMPILER4_UP etc) // peter3
- Removed the JvJCLUtils.ResStr function since it was now a noop (returns input) // peter3

2003-06-22:
- Renamed TJvxGradienCaption to TJvGradientCaption. Renamed JvGrdcpt.pas to JvGradientCaption.pas // peter3
- Added missing units.  // peter3
- Copied needed images from old jvcl to new jvcl3 images folder // peter3
- Moved obsolete or plain useless stuff to \archive // peter3
- Moved unused, support units to \run\unused. These files could possibly go to JCL. We don't need them // peter3

2003-06-21:
- Renamed all BDE units to JvBDEXXX // peter3
- Renamed all DB units to JvDBXXX // peter3
- Removed DBTables and BDE from uses in JvCsvData  // peter3

2003-06-20:
- Merged all run-time util style units (JvAppUtils.pas,JvDateUtil.pas,JvFileUtil.pas,JvFunctions.pas,JvIconClipboardUtils.pas,JvRle.pas,JvStrUtil.pas,JvStrUtils.pas,JvUtils.pas,JvVCLUtils.pas) into JvJVCLUtils and JvJCLUtils (there's one for the interpreter as well, but that is untouched). Basically, anything that goes into JvJCLUtils is stuff that is "JCL compatible", i.e doesn't require Forms.pas or anything from JVCL. Everything else goes into JvJVCLUtils. The JvJCLUtils unit should then be easier to integrate into JCL and eventually be removed. // peter3
- Merged all const type units (JvxDConst.pas, JvConst.pas, JvCtlConst.pas, JvDBConst.pas, JvxRConst.pas) into common\JvConsts and common\JvDBConsts (there's one for the interpreter as well, but that one is untouched). // peter3
- Merged JvDBUtil into JvBDEUtils // peter3
- Moved changelog.txt from \jvcl3\source to \jvcl3 (source will disappear eventually) // peter3

2003-06-17:
- Changed folder structure:
  * Each Delphi/BCB package collection has it's own subfolder in \packages
  * Sources split into a \design folder and a \run folder. Some items are probably incorrectly located at the moment, but this will change as I build the packages
  * All resources (.res and .dcr) are now located in \resources folder
  * All INC and common files are now located in \common
