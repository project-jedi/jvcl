This directory contains the localization files to use with dxGettext (https://github.com/vslavik/gettext-tools-windows)
If you want to add a new language to those that already exist, create a directory for it.
Then create a LC_MESSAGES directory in it, then finally, copy jvcl.po into that last directory.
To find the name you should use for the directory, please use this standard:
ln_CO

where ln is a 2 letter ISO639-1 language code taken from this list: http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/langcodes.html
and CO is a 2 letter country code taken from this list: http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists/list-en1.html

The Country code should only be used when there is a know variation depending on the country where the language is spoken.
For instance, the Portuguese in Brasil (pt_BR) is not the same as the "standard" Portuguese (pt).
Hence, you generally don't have to specify the country code.

Do not forget to update the list of known languages in UpdatePOs.bat so that the new language will be automatically updated when required.
