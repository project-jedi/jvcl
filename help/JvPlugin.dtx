Summary
  Plugin data module.
Description
  TJvPlugin is the base class for new plugins.

  TJvPlugin is not a component but a data module, and as such can contain non-visual components (such
  as TTable, TQuery and TImageList).

  Because it's not a component you can not find it on the component palette. Instead you should use
  File|\New..., click on the 'Projects" tab and click on the 'JEDI Plugin Wizard'. This will generate
  a new project with a single unit containing a TJvPlugin data module.

  In addition a number of properties are provided to specify the identity of the plugin (ID, full
  name, version, author, copyright), commands added by the plugin, the number of instances of this
  plugin that are generated, reference to the host application and the plugin manager.

  For more information on writing plugins and make applications plugin enabled, take a look at <LINK
  $JVCL.Info.Plugins, Writing plugins and plugin enabled applications>.

@@TJvPlugIn.Author
Summary
  \Author of the plugin.
Description
  The \Author property contains the name of the author of this plugin.

  As a plugin writer you should set this to your name, your company name or both.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvPlugIn.Commands
Summary
  Commands provided by the plugin.
Description
  The Commands property is a collection of commands provided by the plugin. A single plugin can
  provide zero or more commands.

  For each command you can specify a bitmap (the icon for the menu or button), its caption, hint,
  custom data and the handler to execute when the command is requested by the host application.

@@TJvPlugIn.Configure
Summary
  Configures the plugin.
Description
  Configure is called by the host application to configure the plugin. As a plugin developer you
  could override this method, but it's better to just assign a handler to the OnConfigure event.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvPlugIn.Copyright
Summary
  Copyright for the plugin.
Description
  The Copyright property contains the copyright notice for the plugin.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvPlugIn.Description
Summary
  \Description of the plugin.
Description
  The \Description property contains the description of the plugin.

  As a plugin writer you should set this to a short (1 or 2 sentences) description of what
  functionality the plugin provides.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvPlugIn.FileName
Summary
  Holds the filename of the plugin.
Description
  Filename holds the filename of the plugin after it is loaded. This can be useful to check if the
  plugin hasn't been renamed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvPlugIn.HostApplication
Summary
  Reference to the TApplication object of the host.
Description
  HostApplication is a reference to the TApplication object of the host. You can both read and write
  to properties (including the MainForm) as well as call methods on this object.

  If you write a plugin to store an MDI child for the host application, you should assign the value
  of this property to your own Application variable and restore your Application variable before you
  destroy the plugin.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvPlugIn.Initialize
Summary
  Initializes the plugin.
Description
  Initialize is called by the host application to initialize the plugin.

  As a plugin developer you could override this method, but it's better to just assign a handler to
  the OnInitialize event. The returned value will be that of the event's AllowLoad parameter.

  As a host application developer you will generally not call this method yourself. Initialize is
  called automatically when the plugin manager loads the plugin.
Parameters
  Manager -         Reference to the host application's plugin manager component.
  HostApplication - Reference to the Application variable of the host.
  FileName -        Name of the DLL or package the plugin is loaded from. This may contain
         <B>CustomPlugin</B> if the plugin is loaded as a custom plugin.

@@TJvPlugIn.OnConfigure
Summary
  Event called when the host requests to configure the plugin.
Description
  Write an OnConfigure event handler to provide a means of configuring the plugin. The host
  application will call the Configure method of the plugin, which in turn will trigger this event.
Parameters
  Sender -  Reference to the plugin.
See Also
  TJvPlugIn.Configure, TJvPlugIn.OnInitialize

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvPlugIn.OnInitialize
Summary
  Event called when the host initializes the plugin.
Description
  Write an OnInitialize event handler to perform any additional setup steps. When this event is
  called, the HostApplication, Manager and FileName properties are already initialized and can thus
  be used by the event.

  The event is called in response to a call to Initialize, which is usually done by the host
  application as soon as the plugin is loaded.
Parameters
  Sender -    Reference to the plugin.
  AllowLoad - Flag to indicate if the plugin may load. Set this parameter to False to prevent the
          plugin from being loaded.

@@TJvPlugIn.OnPluginMessage
Summary
  Event called when the host application sent a message.
Description
  Write an OnPluginMessage event handler to respond to message sent by the host application.
  Although you are free to determine to meaning of each message ID, the host application usually
  defines these message IDs.

  The host application has two means of sending a message:

  * <LINK TJvPluginManager.SendMessage, send a message to all loaded plugins>.
  * <LINK TJvPlugin.SendPluginMessage, send a message to a specific plugin>.
Parameters
  Sender -          Reference to the plugin.
  APluginMessage -  ID of the message. See the host application's documentation of available
                    messages.
  AMessageText -    Additional paramters for the message. See the host application's documentation
                    for the meaning of this string for the message.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvPlugIn.PluginID
Summary
  Identification (name) of the plugin.
Description
  The PluginID property contains the ID (or name) of the plugin.

  As a plugin writer you must set this property to the name (it's not required to set this to the
  Name property or even to a valid Delphi identifier, i.e. spaces and other symbols are allowed) of
  the plugin. Make sure the identification will be unique. A recommended way of doing this would be
  to use an identification string in the form of \<<I>company name or abbreviation</I>\><B>.</B>
  <<I>plugin name</I>\>.

  The host application uses this property to display and identify which plugin(s) is/are loaded.

@@TJvPlugIn.PluginVersion
Summary
  Version of the plugin.
Description
  The PluginVersion property contains the version of the plugin.

  As a plugin writer you should set this property to a string containing the version number. You are
  free to determine how you format the version number (e.g. \<<I>Major</I>\><B>.</B>\<<I>Minor</I>\>
  or \<<I>Major</I>\><B>.</B>\<<I>Minor</I>\><B>.</B>\<<I>Release</I>\>).

  The host application may use this property to display the version of the plugin.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvPlugIn.SendPluginMessage
Summary
  Sends a message to this plugin.
Description
  SendPluginMessage is called by the host application to send a message to the plugin.

  As a plugin developer you should respond to the OnPluginMessage, rather than overriding this
  method. The meaning of the various message IDs are specified by the host application (check its
  documentation to see which message you could receive and what the meaning of the second parameter
  is).

  As a host application developer you can either call this method for a specific plugin or you could
  <LINK TJvPluginManager.SendMessage, broadcast> the message to all loaded plugins. You are
  responsible of defining and documenting the meaning of the various message IDs you support.
Parameters
  APluginMessage -  ID of the message. See the host application's documentation of available
           messages.
  AMessageText -    Additional paramters for the message. See the host application's documentation
                 for the meaning of this string for the message.

@@TJvPluginCommand
Summary
  A single plugin command.
Description
  TJvPluginCommand is single plugin command. Each plugin stores zero or more of the objects in their
  <LINK TJvPlugin.Commands, Commands> property.

  Generally speaking, each plugin usually represents a menu item, a button or both. Because both menu
  items as well as buttons can have a bitmap, a plugin commands can specify a bitmap in addition to a
  caption and a hint text.

  A plugin is not required to have a command (a host may just send messages to the plugin), but
  usually it has at least one.
Note
  Due to an unresolved bug, you should make sure that TJvPluginManager is created <B>before</B> the
  main menu if you add plug-ins to the main menu. TJvPluginManager should be available when the main
  menu is destroyed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvPluginCommand.Bitmap

@@TJvPluginCommand.Data
Summary
  Custom data associated with the command.
Description
