<h2>BCB Compatibility Guide</h2>
<p> </p>
<hr>
<p>This document describes the do's and don'ts of component writing
when you want your Delphi component to work with C++Builder. Many of
these issues were discovered while creating the JVCL packages for BCB6
(Enterprise US, update 2). As such there maybe other problems when
using
these packages with BCB version 5. If you know of such issues or even
any other issues that might help us and other Delphi developers, please
contact the JVCL team through the newsgroups on talkto.net:<br>
<a href="news://forums.talkto.net/jedi.vcl">news://forums.talkto.net/jedi.vcl</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Making your component work with BCB</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Do not use structures like TPoint and TRect as published
property types.</b> Instead, if you need this functionality, use
TJvPoint and TJvRect respectively. They are defined in JvTypes.pas.</li>
  <li><b>Do not use HDC as a published property type.</b> The reason
for
this error is still not found but in the meantime, use LongWord instead.</li>
  <li><b>Do not declare class methods as dynamic.</b> Use virtual
instead.</li>
  <li><b>Do not declare class methods as abstract.</b> Use virtual
instead and provide an empty implementation</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Do not declare a property of
array type.</span> This is not supported, find another way to achieve
the same functionnality. This is different from an indexed property, a
property of array type is something like that: <span
 style="font-style: italic;">property MyProp: TMyArray</span> with <span
 style="font-style: italic;">TMyArray = array [0..n] of char</span>.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Do not use WEAKPACKAGEUNIT if you can avoid it</b>. This will
in some cases cause a linker error, especially if the unit contains
constants, resourcestrings and/or global variables.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Only use Integer in indexed
property getters or setters</span>. If not, this will cause a E2347
error when using the generated hpp file. As a result, it would be
better not to use indexed property getters or setters.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Encountered errors and possible solutions when compiling a package
for BCB</h3>
When creating and/or updating packages with BCB, please keep in mind
that the IDE has a tendancy to put static paths in different locations.
This will prevent the packages from working on a machine different from
your own. For ease of use, you should use the IDE to do add or remove
files, but you will have to do some cleanup. First, you must remove all
required package as BCB will add a lot of unecessary dependencies. For
instance, it adds designintf.bpi in the runtime packages. Then save the
packages, close it and reopen it with a text editor. You will see that
a
bpk file is just a XML file with different nodes for different options.
The cleaning process involves:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Removing all libraries from the SPARELIBS and LIBRARIES nodes.
Yes, all.</li>
  <li>Removing all fixed path (C:\prog\bcb6 for instance) in every
places you see them. If the package refuses to compile after that, you
must change your environment for it to work. There is no way we will
force users to put the JVCL in a particular path. Have a look at the
CJCL60.bpl error below for a solution. You may also want to use the
$(BCB) constant to refer to the location where BCB is installed.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fixing all the wrong relative paths in the FILES nodes in the
FILELIST node. Usually, BCB will add ..\..\design or ..\..\run in front
of the required packages such as rtl.bpi, vcl.bpi and the JVCL ones.
These packages must be specified with no path information.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Once you have cleaned the package, you can reopen it with BCB and
compile it. At first there is a great chance that it will complain
about
missing object files (*.obj) at the linking stage. These are solved by
adding one package after the other in the requires list of the package
you are building. The usual order for BCB6 is:<br>
rtl.bpi, vcl.bpi, vclx.bpi. Database related packages may also require
dbrtl.bpi and vcldb.bpi. With BCB5, rtl.bpi and vcl.bpi are together in
vcl50.bpi<br>
If this is the case, use BCB to update your package, save it, close it
and verify it is still clean (it should, except maybe for SPARELIBS and
some absolute path). Once cleaned again, try to compile it. If it
compiles and links, DO NOT save it. It is fine the way it is, you don't
want to have to clean it again.<br>
On some occasions, BCB may come up with a dialog saying that your
package needs to require other packages in order to be compatible with
installed packages. You must accept these changes. BCB will
automatically recompile and relink your package. You then must save the
changes, reclean your package and retry to compile it.<br>
For design packages, you must try to install it, with all the packages
it depends on installed. For instance if your package depends on
JvCoreC6R.bpi, you must install yours with JvCoreC6D installed.<br>
If all went fine, your package is ready to use. However, there is a
great chance that you will encounter some problems when compiling pas
files and the one we know of are listed below.<br>
<br>
<h5>Null not defined</h5>
<p>You must add 'uses Variant' in the implementation section of the
incriminated pas file even if it was already in the interface section. <br>
Doing so would break Delphi compilation, so you must enclose it with
conditional compilation directives, {$IFDEF BCB6}uses Variant;{$ENDIF}<br>
&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<h5>Cannot find somefile.dcu</h5>
<p>This error occurs because the pascal compiler (yes, pascal, not c++)
couldn't find the indicated dcu file. If the dcu file is available
directly, then add the path to where it is in the include path for the
package. By doing so, please use the $(BCB) constant and not the
absolute path to your installation. <br>
But in most cases, the dcu file is not available in the distribution.
If you have the VCL source, you may find the associated .pas file.
However, DO NOT compile this file, you would break your installation.
The dcu file IS AVAILABLE but not directly, it is included in a .dcp
file and this file must be indicated to the pascal compiler.
Unfortunately, there is no easy way to do that in the IDE, so you will
have to close the package from BCB and reopen it with a text editor.
This is an XML file and the node you're looking for is called PFLAGS.
This contains the flags passed to the pascal compiler. At the end, just
before the closing quote, add the recommended flag (preceded by a
space)
as indicated in the table below:<br>

<br>
<small><sup>*</sup></small>This error should only occur in designtime
packages. If you have this error with a runtime package, please notify
us.<br>
<br>
<h5>Incompatible types: Set of char and String</h5>
<p>Some files in the JVCL were imported from libraries that had partial
support for BCB prior to version 5. As these versions did not support
sets, they were replaced by other constructs, most often strings. But
because JVCL doesn't support anything below BCB5, all conditional
compilation directives defining Delphi sets as string must be removed
to
only leave Delphi style sets definitions and as such remove this error.<br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h5>Incompatible types</h5>
<p>Usually an error that has to do with record constructs being used to
perform automatic casting. This a language feature to avoid as it is
not
supported by BCB.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h5>[Linker Fatal Error] Fatal: Unable to open file 'SOMEFILE.OBJ'</h5>
This is because a bpi file is missing from the requires node of the
package your are trying to build. The table below indicates the name of
the bpi files you need to add for different missing obj files<br>
<table
 style="width: 50%; text-align: left; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"
 border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">

file<br>
      </td>
      <td

    </tr>

      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">vcl.bpi<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
Note that for BCB5, vcl.bpi and rtl.bpi are merged into vcl50.bpi<br>
<br>
<h5>[Linker Fatal Error] Fatal: Cannot find CJCL60.bpl</h5>
<p>You must add CJCL60.bpi to the requires list of your package. The
directory to both CJCL60.bpi and CJCL60.bpl MUST be in the PATH
environment variable. If you don't have these files, you need to
compile
the JCL first, with the BCB6 specific packages. Remember that you must
use JCL version 1.9 or newer in order to compile the JVCL 3.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h5>[Linker Fatal Error] Fatal: Access violation. Link Terminated.</h5>
<p>See "Do not use WEAKPACKAGEUNIT" above. These errors should have
been all removed from the JVCL following the discovery of a useless
WEAKPACKAGEUNIT directive in the file JclResources.pas from the
JCL.&nbsp; Their team has been informed and the file has been updated
in version 1.9 and newer.<br>
Before discovering this error, we found that changing the order of the
bpi files in the FILELIST node sometimes solved this crash. It is not
clear what is the best order, but you may want to try shuffling around
the order of CJCL60.bpi, JvCoreC6R.bpi and JvCoreC6D.bpi<br>
</p>
<p>This problem may arise from other files and because it actually is
the result of the linker crashing, it is very hard to track down.
Borland has been told about this problem, we are yet to receive any
answer from them.</p>
<p>Please note that sometimes, the linker decides to crash on its own,
giving you two linker errors. If this happens, close BCB and reopen it.
<br>
</p>
<p>Finally, it seems that Update 4 for BCB6 corrected most errors in
the linker and as a result we won't support any BCB installation that
doesn't use Update 4.<br>

<h3>Encountered errors and possible solutions when compiling an
application using a JVCL component</h3>
These errors generally occur in a JVCL related hpp file. The hpp files
are generated from the interface section of the pas files which
requires
that your components follow some simple rules so that the generated hpp
file is a valid file. Some people have suggested that we should put the
hpp files in the distribution packages so that we can modify them in
order to repair them after they have been generated. This is not
possible because those modified files would be overwritten when the
users recompile the JVCL on their computers. And not requiring the
users
to recompile would mean a precompiled distribution package at least 80M
big !<br>
So we are asking every developer in the JVCL team to follow the above
mentionned guidelines. However, from times to times, somebody may
encounter an error when using one of the JVCL components. The below
list
contains the known errors and their solutions.<br>
<br>
<h5>E2238 Multiple declaration for '_fastcall TJvClass::TJvClass'<br>
</h5>
<p>This one is coupled with an E2344 error. This problems comes from
the fact that in C++, constructors are named after the class name and
there is no way to change that. So to avoid confusion, avoid calling
your constructors anything else than Create. If you need additionnal
parameters, use the overload directive and adapt your code to take this
into account. The disctinction between the different constructors is
made upon the order and the types of their parameters. <br>
</p>
<p>But in the end, this may not be enough as Borland's VCL already
contains a number of constructors. As a result, the types you chose to
use for your own constructor may conflict with an existing constructor.
In such a case, you should follow Borland's guidelines from their help
files: Add a dummy parameter at the end, giving it a default value.
Usually, an Integer parameter is enough, like this:<br>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">constructor Create(param1 : string;
param2 : Integer; dummyForBCB : Byte = 0);<br>
</div>
<p>From the C++ code, to be sure to call the correct constructor, you
must give a value for this dummy parameter even if it won't be used.</p>
<br>
<h5>E2303 Type name expected (on a __property line)</h5>
<p>This is because of bad casing on an inherited property. The usual
example is having a property named PopUpMenu where it should be
PopupMenu. BCB is case sensitive so you must respect casing in your pas
files, at least in the interface section.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h5>E2040 Declaration terminated incorrectly</h5>
<p>This generally happens on a constant declaration and is because the
pas files declares a value for a constant that already exists in the
header files bundled with BCB. You must tell the hpp generator not to
include this constant by adding a $EXTERNALSYM compilation directive in
the pas file, just after your pascal constant. For instance, you must
do
this for S_OK</p>
<p>const S_OK : Integer = 0;<br>
{$EXTERNALSYM S_OK}<br>
&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<h5>Cannot initialize constant</h5>
<p>(or something similar, usually provokes 3 errors on the same line,
the second being the interesting one). This is because the parameter
name you chose for your function is a constant under BCB. The only
solution is to change the name of the incriminated parameter. This was
found with a parameter called SwitchChars in the GetCmdLineArg function
in JvJCLUtils.pas<br>
<br>
</p>
<h5>E2347 Parameter mismatch in access specifier &#8216;specifier&#8217; of
property &#8216;property&#8217;<br>
</h5>
<p>This is generally because the component doesn't uses Integer as its
index type for an indexed property getter or setter. You can always
avoid using indexed property setters, so please don't use them.<br>
</p>
&nbsp;
<h5>E2015 Ambiguity between SOMETYPE and SomeDomain::SOMETYPE</h5>
<p>This is because the type SOMETYPE is a global type (in windows.h,
generally) and is also defined in the SomeDomain file. To lift this
ambiguity, you must add a line at the beginning of the pas file that
does that: "{$HPPEMIT '#define SOMETYPE SomeDomain::SOMETYPE'}". But if
SOMETYPE is a JVCL type (starts with TJv) then this is because
SomeDomain.pas contains a bogus declaration and should be fixed. Please
notify us if that problem occurs.<br>
</p>
<p>ATTENTION: If the second type is a function like in
"JclWin32::WORD(const unsigned int)" you MUST not add this HPPEMIT
directive. The problem in this case comes from the fact that a function
defined in the .pas file is named exactly as a macro in the windows
header an gets replaced by its value. For instance in the given
example,
LANGFROMLCID was replaced by its value which is WORD and that lead to
the declaration of LANGFROMLCID(const unsigned int) from the pascal
code
to be replaced by WORD(const unsigned int).<br>
</p>
<p>However, if this error is generated in an hpp file not from the JVCL
(filename not starting with Jv), such as Controls.hpp, you can't change
this file, you must reorder the units in your uses clause so that the
conflict goes away. For instance, in the case of Controls.hpp, the
solution was to put Controls before Windows in the uses clause.<br>
