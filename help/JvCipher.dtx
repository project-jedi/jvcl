Summary
  Enables you to (de)cipher strings.
Description
  TJvCaesarCipher is a component to (de)cipher strings or series of bytes using "Caesar Cipher", one of 
  he simplest forms of substitution cipher. The method is named after Julius Ceasar who - as is said
  - used this method to communicate with his army. The ciphering is usually done by substituting each
  letter in a message by a letter that is on a fixed distance in the alphabet. TJvCaesarCipher uses
  the whole character set (256 characters) for ciphering strings or series of bytes.
  This makes it possible to cipher any series of bytes (not necessarily readable strings).
  When used with strings it may result in strings that do not even look like strings anymore.
  
  Caesar Cipher is not a safe method to cipher text. When used with strings it is easy to crack.
  
  The Key property must represent a number. If it does not, the value 13 will be used.

@@TJvCustomCipher.IsStored
Summary
  If True, the Key and Encoded properties are stored in the DFM file
Description
  For security reasons, you may not want to store the Encoded and Key values in the DFM file, and as
  result they wouldn't appear in the final exe file. If that is the case, set this property to False
  and the Encoded and Key values will not be stored. For backward compatibility, this property is
  True by default.

JVCLInfo
  GROUP=JVCL.System.Encryption
  FLAG=Component
Summary
  A component that encodes and decodes according to the Vigenere cipher method
Description
  Here is a short explanation of the vigenere cipher, inspired by the much more complete description
  available at this address:
  http://www.trincoll.edu/depts/cpsc/cryptography/vigenere.html
  
  For each letter of the Key, a new alphabet is created by shifting the usual alphabet to start at
  the same letter as in the key. For instance, if the key is CUP then three alphabets are created:
  
   CDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZAB
   UVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST
   PQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNO
  
  When encoding a string, each alphabet is used in turn as a lookup table. For instance, if we encode
  HELLO, then we have this:
  
  H --> J
  E --> Y
  L --> A
  L --> N
  O --> I
  
  As you can see, the same letter is not always encoded by the same letter, thus making statistical
  analysis a bit harder. The implementation in this component considers an alphabet of 255
  characters, thus encoding every single character no matter what its value is.

@@TJvXORCipher
<TITLEIMG TJvXORCipher>
JVCLInfo
  GROUP=JVCL.System.Encryption
  FLAG=Component
Summary
  A component that can encode and decode using the XOR algorithm
Description
  The XOR algorithm is really simple and as such really easy to crack. However it is fast and uses a
  symetrical algorithm:
  
  Encoded[I] = Decoded[I] XOR Key[J]
  Decoded[I] = Encoded[I] XOR Key[J]
  
  Set the Encoded property to get the \decoded value in Decoded.
  Set the Decoded property to get the \encoded value in Encoded.
  
  Note: As the algorithm is symetrical, there is virtually no difference between setting Encoded or
  Decoded to get the resulting value.
  
  Each element of the string will be \encoded by its corresponding element in the Key. If the
  Key is too short, it is reused from the start.
