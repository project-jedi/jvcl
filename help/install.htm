<h1>Installation Notes for JVCL</h1>
<h3> </h3>
<hr>
<h2>Current version</h2>
<p>The current version of JVCL is 3.00 beta 1, released on 2004-02-20<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Supported compiler versions</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following compilers are supported by the JVCL:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Delphi 5</li>
  <li>Delphi 6</li>
  <li>Delphi 7</li>
  <li>C++ Builder 5</li>
  <li>C++ Builder 6<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Uninstalling previous versions of JVCL</h2>
<p>If you have a previous version of the JVCL installed, you must
remove it completely along with the JCL before
installing this version. To remove a previous installation, proceed as
follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start the IDE, open the packages page by selecting <b>Component
- Install Packages</b></li>
  <li>Select each of the JCL / JVCL packages in the list and click the <b>Remove</b>
button</li>
  <li>Open <b>Tools - Environment Options - Library</b> and remove all
library paths pointing to JVCL and JCL folders</li>
  <li>Repeat step 1 to 3 for every version of Delphi and C++ Builder
you have installed</li>
  <li>Close the IDE<br>
  </li>
  <li>Browse to the folder where your bpl and dcp files are located
(default is $(DELPHI)\Projects\Bpl for Delphi, $(BCB)\Projects\Bpl for
C++ Builder). Delete all of the files related to JVCL and JCL</li>
  <li>Delete or rename the top folder where JCL and JVCL is installed</li>
  <li>Start regedit (click <b>Start - Run</b>, type "regedit.exe" and
hit <b> Enter</b>). Open the key <font size="2" face="Courier New">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Borland\&lt;compiler&gt;\&lt;version&gt;\Palette</font>
and delete all name/value items in the list related to JVCL.
(&lt;compiler&gt; is either "Delphi" or "C++Builder", &lt;version&gt;
is the IDE version you have installed)</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>Getting required packages</h2>
<p align="left">JVCL requires that you also install the latest version
of JCL (JEDI Code Library). Currently, this is the JCL 1.9 Beta 2
(Build
1400), but
newer versions might have been released since this document was
published. The file you need is here: <a
 href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jcl/Jcl1.90Build1391.zip?download"></a><a
 href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jcl/Jcl1.90Build1400.zip?download"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jcl/Jcl1.90Build1400.zip?download</span></a><br>
and instructions for the JCL can be found starting at this
page:&nbsp; <a href="http://homepages.borland.com/jedi/jcl/">http://homepages.borland.com/jedi/jcl/</a>.</p>
<p align="left">As of today (27th of December 2003), the JCL package
contains all that is needed to make the JVCL preview work, especially
with C++ Builder.</p>
<p align="left">However, if you are using a daily zip package or a CVS
version
of the JVCL, please ensure that you are also using the very latest
version of the JCL or you may not be able to install the JVCL. If you
do not have access to the JCL CVS
repository, please ask us and we may be able to provide you with a zip
file containing a version known to build.<br>
<br>
</p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2 align="left">Installing using the JVCL Installer</h2>
<p align="left">An installer is provided with the JVCL distribution and
it is the recommended way of installing the JVCL. If using it is not an
option or it doesn't work for you, please see the section below on
manual installation.<br>
</p>
<div class="InfoField">
<p align="left"><br>
Even if you use the installer, you must first remove
any JVCL (before version 3) and JCL (any version) manually. For
instructions on manual removal, see the section above titled
"Uninstalling previous versions of JVCL". For removing a previous
installation of JVCL version 3, see the section "Uninstalling using the
Installer" below.<br>
</p>
</div>
<p align="left"><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<div class="InfoField">
<p align="left"><br>
The installer does not copy any files: instead, it
builds and installs the packages in the Delphi/BCB IDE. So, before
running the installer, make sure the JVCL (and JCL) files are located
in the folder where you want them to be.<br>
</p>
</div>
<p align="left">To use the installer, first make sure Delphi or
C++Builder are closed (the installer will not be able to run if they
are active) and then double-click the install.bat file in the jvcl
root. The installer will be compiled using the Delphi command-line
compiler dcc32.exe. If the compile fails, open a command prompt in the
jvcl folder, type "install.bat" and hit &lt;ENTER&gt;. You should now
be able to see any error messages displayed and respond accordingly. If
the error message says that dcc32.exe could not be found, make sure the
path to your Delphi or C++ Builder \bin folder is in your system path
and try running install.bat again. </p>
<p align="left">Once the compilation succeeds, the installer is started
automatically and it should look something like this: </p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">
<img border="0" src="images/installer_main.jpg" width="689" height="476"></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">At the top left is a list of all installed and
supported Delphi and C++Builder editions. Check the ones for which you
want to install the JVCL. </p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Below the list is a set of checkboxes for selecting
different features of the install. The following features are available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b>Build packages</b> - build instead of compile.
When building, all dcu's are regenerated even if not absolutely
necessary. This is recommended when reinstalling. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b>Install JCL</b> - also compiles the JCL
package(s). If the JCL is in the same parent folder as the jvcl (for
example, JVCL is in JEDI\jvcl and JCL is in JEDI\jcl), it will be
detected automatically. If you have the JCL files in another folder,
specify it's path by clicking the ellipsis button next to the edit box
labeled "JCL" (see below). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b>JVCL Developer Installation</b> - determines
what paths to add to Delphi/BCB's library path. If checked,&nbsp;the
paths to \run and \common are added. If unselected, the paths to the
dcu output folder is added instead (the dcu putput folder is specific
for each Delphi/BCB version). A developer install is recommended if you
plan to make changes to the source units, a "normal" install is
recommended if you are only planning on using JVCL without modifying it
yourself. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b>Clean JVCL component palette</b> - removes old
JVCL component palette entries from the registry. This assures that
components are located on their default palette after installation.
Recommended. </p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p align="left" dir="ltr"><b>Compile only (error check)</b> -
builds everything as specified but does not install anything into
Delphi/BCB. Good for checking for errors before doing a real install. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b>Hpp files</b> - only enabled when a C++Builder
version is selected in the compiler list. If the displayed path is
wrong, click the ellipsis button to select another path. Click the "BCB
installation guide" link (only visible when a BCB compiler is selected)
to display a document with detailed instructions on installation in
C++Builder. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b>Standard/Personal Edition</b> - checked if you
have Delphi 5 Standard or any of the Personal Editions installed. These
editions have less functionality and some features in JVCL have to be
disabled to make it work with these editions. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b>JCL</b> - displays the path to the JCL folder.
If the displayed folder is wrong, click the ellipsis button to select
another folder. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Next comes a couple of checkboxes that controls the
enabling and disabling of specific features in JVCL. You can check the
boxes directly or click on the <b>Advanced</b> button to see all
available options in a dialog. The options are read from the jvcl.inc
file (in the \common folder) and displayed in the list, so they might
differ from what is shown below if options have been added or removed
since this dcument was written. Select an item to see it's explanation.
Check an item to enable it, uncheck to disable it. </p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">
<img border="0" src="images/installer_config_editor.jpg" width="750"
 height="429"></p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">These are the currently available options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b>JVCL_REGISTER_GLOBAL_DESIGNEDITORS </b>- if
enabled, registers property editors for common types so the property
editor can be used with any component, not only those in JVCL. </p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p align="left" dir="ltr"><b>USEJVCL </b>- some packages
(JvGlobus, JvUIB, JvTimeFramework, JvDocking, JvDotNet, JvXPCtrls,
JvWizard) can be installed as "stand-alone" as well as a part of JVCL.
If you only need a single package from the JVCL (like JvWizard),
disable this define. If you plan to install other parts of the JVCL as
well, you are recommended to enable it. </p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr"><b>USE_DXGETTEXT </b>- if you have dxgettext
installed (<a href="http://dxgettext.sourceforge.net">http://dxgettext.sourceforge.net</a>)
and want to use it with JVCL, you should enable this define. A PO file
with the JVCL strings is located in \devtools\po (\devtools is only
included in the full JVCL install). </p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p align="left" dir="ltr"><b>DelphiPersonalEdition </b>- enable
this define if you are using Delphi 5 Standard or one of the Delphi/BCB
Personal Editions. The Standard and Personal Editions do not support
all components included in JVCL (mostly database related) and enabling
this define will remove these components from the JVCL palettes. </p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p align="left" dir="ltr"><b>JVCLThemesEnabled </b>- enable this
define if you have Delphi 7 or want to use Mike Lischke's ThemeManager (<a
 href="http://www.lischke-online.de">http://www.lischke-online.de</a>).
Note that even if you enable theme support, you still need a manifest
for your application and you will only see the effects of theming when
running on Windows XP. </p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p align="left" dir="ltr"><b>USE_JV_GIF </b>- enable this define
if you want to enable JVCL's GIF support. Disable if want to use
another GIF library or don't want GIF support. </p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p align="left" dir="ltr"><b>USE_PROGESSBAR </b>- enable to use a
standard TProgressbar instead of a TGauge (from the Sample palette) in
some components. </p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p align="left" dir="ltr"><b>USE_FOUR_DIGIT_YEAR </b>- controls
whether TDateEdit and descendants are forced to use four digit years in
their display. When disabled, the ShortDateFormat is used to determine
the number of year digits. </p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p align="left" dir="ltr"><b>DEFAULT_POPUP_CALENDAR </b>- enable
to use a popup calendar in TDateEdit and descendants. If disabled, uses
a modal dialog instead. </p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p align="left" dir="ltr"><b>TIMEBLOCKS </b>- used by the
JvTimeFramework components and should be enabled unless you have very
specific reason not to (see JvTFDays.pas for more info). </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Fillling up most of the installer window is a list of
all available design packages. To see the run-time packages as well,
check the "<b>Show runtime packages</b>" at the top right. Note that
the installation compiles all required packages regardless of what is
currently displayed in the list.</p>
<p align="left">Select the packages you want to install by checking and
unchecking the items in the list. When you check a package, all
packages that it depends on are checked as well. If you uncheck a
package that other packages depends on, they will be unchecked
automatically. </p>
<p align="left">We recommend that you check all packages for a first
time install and if you decide later on that you don't want to use a
specific package, uncheck or remove it from Delphi/BCB's&nbsp; package
manager dialog (<b>Components|Install Packages</b> in Delphi).</p>
<p align="left">When you are done selecting packages, click the <b>Install
</b>button. A progress dialog is displayed that shows details about
what is currently happening. If something goes wrong, see the Compiler
Output tab for detailed error messages. </p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Once the packages are compiled and installed, you
should be ready to start using JVCL.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="left">Uninstalling with the Installer</h2>
<p align="left">To remove the JVCL, run the installer and click the <b>Uninstall
</b>button instead. This will uninstall and delete <i>all
</i>JVCL related bpl, dcp and dcu files, regardless of package
selection in the list. Note that the uninstall option will only work
for
<i>this </i>version of JVCL, not the previous 2.10 version or any
version before that.<br>
<br>
</p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2>Manual install for Delphi<br>
</h2>
<p>Start by unpacking the JVCL and JCL zip files into a folder of your
own choice. Make sure your zip extractor is set to maintain folder
structure or all files will be put into the same folder (<b>not</b>
what
you want!). We recommend but do not require that the JCL and JVCL
folders should be created as siblings, i.e the
folder structure looks like this:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">JEDI<br>
&nbsp; JCL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;JCL subfolders&gt;<br>
&nbsp; JVCL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;JVCL subfolders&gt;<br>
</font></p>
<p dir="ltr">Before you can install the JVCL you must first compile the
JCL packages. How to do this is documented in the JCL download. If the
JCL works as expected, open the JVCL package group file (bpg) for your
version of
Delphi that is located in the jvcl\packages folder. Select <b>Project
-
Build All Projects</b> from the Delphi menu. Go get a cup of coffee
(this
takes a while). After Delphi has compiled all the packages, open the <b>Project
Manager</b> (Ctrl+Alt+F11) and right-click each of the packages ending
with D?D (where ? is the version number, "5" for Delphi 5, "6" for
Delphi 6 etc) and select "<b>Install</b>" from the pop-up menu.
Although
you can skip installing some of the packages, we still recommend that
you install all of them the first time. You can later remove some of
them on a project by project basis or permanently if you never use the
components in the package and the package isn't required by another
installed package.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have several versions of Delphi installed, you will have to
go through these steps for each version, the only difference being the
bpg file you load into the IDE.</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<div class="InfoField"> <br>
When closing a package, Delphi will prompt you
to save the changes to the package. You <b>MUST </b>answer "No" to
this question
since Delphi removes some conditional defines needed the next time you
recompile the package. <br>
</div>
<br>
<h2>Adding JVCL paths to Delphi</h2>
<p>To make your applications find the JVCL code when you compile, you
need to add the paths to JVCL to Delphi's environment paths. You have
two options: either add the paths to the JVCL source files or add the
paths to the precompiled DCU files. Both have their drawbacks and
benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding the source paths means you can easily make changes to the
source and see it at run-time but be aware that if you build with
run-time packages, you need to recompile the packages to see the
changes
in the application. To add the source folder locations to Delphi,
select <b>Tools-Environment
Options-Library</b> and add the paths to <b><i> JVCL\run</i></b> and <i><b>
JVCL\common</b></i> to the Library path.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding the pre-compiled DCU paths means that Delphi won't have to
recompile
the DCU's unless you recompile the packages, so compiling your
application should be faster. To add the DCU folder location, select <b>Tools-Environment
Options-Library</b> and add <i><b> JVCL\lib\XX</b></i> (where XX is
your version
of Delphi or BCB, i.e for Delphi 6, it's "d6", for BCB 5 it's "c5" etc)
and
<i><b>JVCL\common</b></i> (for the INC
files) to the Library path.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="InfoField">
<b><br>
</b> When adding the DCU output folder to the Library path, you
must also copy all dfm files from the \run folder to the DCU&nbsp;
folder or
Delphi won't be able to find them.&nbsp;<br>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still want to be able to open the
JVCL source files in the IDE, add <i><b> JVCL\run</b></i> (and maybe
even <b><i>JVCL\design</i></b>)
to the Browsing Path list.</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<h2><big><font size="2"><big>Reinstalling </big></font></big> and<font
 size="2"><big> updating for Delphi</big><br>
</font></h2>
<p>To reinstall or update a package, use the same approach as in the <b>Manual
Install</b> section above with the following additions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In Delphi 5, uninstall all affected JVCL packages before
rebuilding. Delphi 5 has a problem updating already installed packages,
especially when the package have dependencies. Delphi 6 and Delphi 7
handles this better but you are recommended to remove them anyway
since it minimizes the probability of errors. To uninstall, select <b>Component
- Install Package</b>, select the JVCL packages in the list and click
the <b>Remove</b> button. Click <b>OK</b> to close the dialog (if
you click Cancel the packages will not be removed).</li>
</ul>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2>Manual install for C++ Builder<br>
</h2>
<p>Please note that manual installation for C++ Builder is rather
complicated and we strongly advised you to use the automatic installer
if possible.<br>
</p>
<p>Start by unpacking the JVCL and JCL zip files into a folder of your
own choice. Make sure your zip extractor is set to maintain folder
structure or all files will be put into the same folder (<b>not</b>
what
you want!). </p>
<p>The JVCL for C++ Builder doesn't assume that the JCL is installed in
the same base folder as JVCL, but we do recommend that the JCL and JVCL
folders are created as siblings, i.e the folder structure should look
like this:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">JEDI<br>
&nbsp; JCL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;JCL subfolders&gt;<br>
&nbsp; JVCL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;JVCL subfolders&gt;<br>
</font></p>
<p><br>
Open the JCL package group specific to your version of
C++&nbsp;Builder. It
is called JclPackagesCxx.bpg where xx is to be replaced by 50 for
C++&nbsp;Builder&nbsp;5 and 60 for C++&nbsp;Builder&nbsp;6. Select <b>Project
- Build All Projects</b> from the C++&nbsp;Builder menu. C++ Builder
will prompt you for the location of CJcl.bpi. This file doesn't exist
yet, simply choose Cancel on that dialog. Once the compilation is
finished, close the package group
(File, Close All). Do NOT save anything.</p>
<p>Because all components are written in pascal, the JVCL requires a
dcp
file from the JCL to correctly build. This file is not distributed with
the JCL but will be generated for you by the MakeJCLDcp4BCB.bat batch
file. To run this batch file, first open
a Command prompt (also called MS-DOS window under Windows 95, 98 and
Me) and browse to the JVCL\packages directories. Calling MakeJCLDcp4BCB
without any argument will bring a help
message to tell you what are the values you need to pass to the batch
file:<br>

 style="font-family: monospace;"></span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
</div>
<p><br>
A typical call is "MakeJCLDcp4BCB 6" and will generate the dcp
file for C++ Builder 6, using the default values for all other
parameters (BCBDirectory=c:\program&nbsp;files\cbuilder6,
JCLDirectory=..\..\jcl and DCPDirectory=Projects\bpl).<br>
Unless you update the JCL, you won't have to regenerate
the dcp files when you update the JVCL.<br>
</p>
<p> Now, open the package group file (bpg) for your version of
C++&nbsp;Builder that is located in the jvcl\packages folder. Please
note that C++ Builder 6 Personal has its own group file.<br>
Select <b>Project
- Build All Projects</b> from the C++&nbsp;Builder menu. As with the
JCL, C++&nbsp;Builder will complain about missing .bpi files. Simply
click Cancel everytime the dialog shows up.
This is because the last packages in the list require the first ones to
be compiled and of course they are not yet compiled at the beginning of
the process. This behaviour is thought to be a bug in C++ Builder, if
you know a
way to turn that off, please let us know. Another approach that doesn't
trigger all these dialogs is to
right-click in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Project Manager</span>
and select 'Build' for each package in turn. <br>
Finally you could also use the provided MakeBCB* batch files instead.
Open
a Command prompt window, change to the directory where the batch files
are and launch the one appropriate for your version of C++ Builder. By
default, it assumes that C++ Builder is installed in c:\program
files\cbuilder?, where ? is the version number (5 or 6). If it is not
located there, you must indicate the path to it as the first argument
to the batch file.<br>

<p>After all packages are compiled, open the <b>Project Manager</b>
(Ctrl+Alt+F11) and right-click each of the packages ending with C?D
(where ? is the version number, "5" for C++&nbsp;Builder&nbsp;5, "6"
for C++&nbsp;Builder&nbsp;6) and select "<b>Install</b>" from the
pop-up menu. You must start from the beginning of the list or some
packages may not be able to get installed. Although you can skip
installing some of the packages, we still recommend that you install
all of them the first time. You can later remove some of them on a
project by project basis or permanently if you never use the components
in the package and the package isn't required by another installed
package. Due to another bug in C++ Builder, the packages will be
recompiled and relinked before being installed. We have no knowledge of
any option to prevent this from happening.<br>
</p>
<p><br>
If you have several versions of C++&nbsp;Builder installed, you will
have to go through these steps for each version, the only difference
being the bpg file you load into the IDE.<br>
<br>
</p>
<div class="InfoField"><br>
When closing a package, C++&nbsp;Builder will
prompt you to save the changes to the package. You MUST answer "No" to
this question since saving will most likely render the packages
unusable
for the next time you want to compile the JVCL.<br>
</div>
<br>
<h2><a name="AddJVCLPathToBCB"></a>Adding JVCL paths to C++&nbsp;Builder<br>
</h2>
<p>To make your applications find the JVCL header and resource files
when you
compile, two options are available to you:<br>
</p>
<p><br>
1) You are willing to add files in the installation directory of C++
Builder. This is the easiest solution but forces you to repeat this
step every time you update the JVCL. Here are the steps:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Copy all .hpp files to $(BCB)\Include&nbsp; (those files are in
JCL\source subdirectories, in JVCL\run and JVCL\common)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Copy all .res files to $(BCB)\Lib&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (those files
are in JVCL\resources)</li>
  <li>Copy all .dfm files to $(BCB)\Lib&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (those files
are in JVCL\run)</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
2) You don't want to copy all the header and resource files in your
installation directory. Then you need to add the JVCL paths to
C++&nbsp;Builder's
environment paths but this has a big drawback: You will have to ask
people using your sources to setup their installation of C++ Builder so
that it defines the environment variables mentionned hereafter. <br>
</p>
<p>All you need to do is start C++&nbsp;Builder and select <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">File-Close All</span>. <br>
</p>
Select <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tools-Environment Options</span>,
then in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Environment Variables</span>
tab, in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">User overrides</span>
section, click <span style="font-weight: bold;">New...</span> , set
the variable name to INCLUDEPATH and its value to
'JVCL\common;JVCL\run;jcl\source\common;jcl\source\vcl;jcl\source\visclx;jcl\source\windows'
(without the quotes).<br>
Create a second variable called RESPATH and set its value to
'JVCL\run;JVCL\resources' (without the quotes).
<p>Do not forget to add the complete path to where you installed the
JVCL and JCL. For instance, if you put the JVCL in c:\prog\lib\, then
'JVCL\common' becomes 'c:\prog\lib\JVCL\common'.<br>
</p>
<p>We are aware of the existence of the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Library path</span> value in the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Library</span>
tab. But for a reason beyond our understanding, these paths are ignored
by the compiler and linker. They are only used when looking for
packages, not resource or include files.<br>
</p>
<p>Finally,
and whatever version of C++ Builder you are using, ensure you have
closed all open projects. Select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Directories/Conditionals</span>
tab in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Project-Options</span> and add
this path to the Include paths:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>;$(INCLUDEPATH)</li>
</ul>
and this path to the Library paths:<br>
<ul>
  <li>;$(RESPATH)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
Unfortunately, the concept of Environment variables overrides doesn't
exists under C++ Builder 5. And it seems that using environment
variables is not possible either. The solution is then to directly add
the directories mentionned before to the default project options. To do
that, ensure you have
closed all open projects. Select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Directories/Conditionals</span>
tab in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Project-Options</span> and add
this path to the Include paths:<br>
<ul>
  <li>;JVCL\common;JVCL\run;jcl\source\common;jcl\source\vcl;jcl\source\visclx;jcl\source\windows</li>
</ul>
and this path to the Library paths:<br>
<ul>
  <li>;JVCL\run;JVCL\resources</li>
</ul>
Do not forget to add the complete path to where you installed the
JVCL and JCL. For instance, if you put the JVCL in c:\prog\lib\, then
'JVCL\common' becomes 'c:\prog\lib\JVCL\common'.<br>
You should now be able to compile and
link projects using the JVCL. If someone sends you a project, you will
have to repeat this to match your configuration.<br>
<br>
<p>In both cases, if you want to be able to open the JVCL source files
in the IDE by
using the navigation shorctuts, add those paths to the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Browsing Path</span>
list in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Library</span> tab of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Tools-Environment Options</span>:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>JCL\source\common</li>
  <li>JCL\source\vcl</li>
  <li>JCL\source\visclx</li>
  <li>JCL\source\windows</li>
  <li>JVCL\run</li>
  <li>JVCL\common</li>
</ul>
<br>
You will then be able to use the JVCL components. If you do some
modifications to the JVCL source code to add functionality and/or fix
bugs, remember to recompile the package in which the modified files are
included or you won't see the effect of your changes.<br>

<p>To reinstall or update a package, use the same approach as in the <b>Manual
Install</b> section above with the following additions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You should always remove the JVCL packages before rebuilding
them. To uninstall, select <b>Component - Install Package</b>, select
the JVCL packages in the list and click the <b>Remove</b> button.
Click <b>OK</b>
to close the dialog (if you click Cancel the packages will not be
removed).</li>
