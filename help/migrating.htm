<h1>Migrating your applications from previous versions of JEDI VCL</h1>
<h2> </h2>
<hr>
<h2> Introduction</h2>
<p>Since the previous release JVCL has undergone some major changes.
Old components have been bug fixed, enhanced, merged and&nbsp;removed,
new components and libraries have been added, units have been renamed
and the previous monolithic package has been split into several smaller
packages. The folder structure has also changed: Source files have been
rearranged into design and run folders, packages have been moved into
separate folders based on the supported compiler version. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Taken together, moving your applications from JVCL 2.10 to the
current version can seem to be quite a daunting task and many things
can go wrong if migration tasks aren't performed in the right order
using the right tools. This document is a help in making this migration
as easy as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that although the document refers to "Delphi" in several
places, the instructions applies equally to other versions of Borland
GUI's (like C++Builder and Kylix) unless the text specifically says
otherwise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>General migration issues</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you start moving your application to the latest JVCL, you
must make sure that you can go back if something goes wrong. To
accomplish this, you must perform the following steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure you save all DFM files in text format. This simplifies
manual editing (for example with Notepad) of them in case you can't
load them into Delphi. The command line program <b>&lt;Delphi&gt;\bin\convert.exe</b>,
supplied with all version of Delphi, allows quick, mass conversion of
DFMs. Run convert at a command prompt to see usage instructions. </li>
  <li>Make a complete backup of your current JVCL and JCL installations
and store in a safe place </li>
  <li>Make a complete backup of your application(s) and store in a safe
place</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You also need to make sure that Delphi doesn't use use the old JVCL
sources and/or binaries once you've started the migration. To make sure
that none of the old files are used by Delphi, you should</p>
<ul>
  <li>Start Delphi, go to "Install Packages", select any JCL and JVCL
packages in the list and click the remove button </li>
  <li>Go to Environment Options and remove any paths to JCL and JVCL
from the Library, Search, Debug&nbsp;and Browse path lists </li>
  <li>Close Delphi. Delete all JCL and JVCL folders from your computer.
Delete all JCL and JVCL dcu, dcp, bpl and other related files from your
computer</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your computer should now be "JVCL free" and you are ready to start
migrating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step one - installation</h3>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Before you can start using the new JVCL, you need to install it.
Follow the instructions in install.htm to install JCL/JVCL. Add any
required paths to the Environment Options in Delphi. Since it is
impossible to know what JVCL packages you will actually need in your
development, we recommend that you start by installing all of them. You
can go back later and remove or deactivate those that you don't use. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Make sure that you can use the JVCL components by creating a new
empty project, drop a few JVCL components on the form and try to run
it. If the application builds and runs without errors, you are ready to
start using JVCL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step two - search and replace</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After successfully installing JVCL, you need to go through your
application sources outside Delphi and replace any occurrences of old
unit, class and type names with the new names. You can do this manually
by referencing the list of renames in readme.htm and changelog.txt but
it is a lot simpler to use the JVCL Convert program and the provided
conversion data file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="InfoField"> JVCL Convert is a tool that can search a set of
selected files and replace occurrences of one text with another by
reading the entries in a conversion file. A conversion file contains
pairs of old/new values.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The source to JVCL convert is in the &lt;<b>JVCL&gt;\devtools\JVCLConvert</b>,
a precompiled exe is in &lt;<b>JVCL&gt;\devtools\bin</b> and all
available dat files are in &lt;<b>JVCL&gt;\converter</b>.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A conversion file named JVCL3.dat is provided with the download of
JVCL. Run the JVCLConvert program with the JVCL3.dat file on your
application source files. You can know try to open your project in
Delphi. If it opens and compiles without problem, you are finished and
can start using JVCL 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step three - replace removed components</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some cases, the simple replacement of unit, class and type names
isn't sufficient to make your application run. For example, if you use
a component that has been removed or replaced by&nbsp; another
component, properties will most likely be named differently or the
components design might be so different that the old properties aren't
even usable with the new component. You could even be forced to recode
the logic in your application to match the workings of the new
component. Some suggestions for dealing with common problems are given <a
 href="#ManualRep">below</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way to sort these problems out is to compare the old
components design with the new one and make decision based on that. In
rare cases, you can't replace the old component with a new one and need
to keep the old one in use. We never delete components once they have
been added to JVCL. Instead, all old components are available in the
\archive folder (this folder is only included in the full install). To
use, you will need to manually add the component unit(s) to a package
of your choice and you will most likely also have to write a Register
procedure to install it in Delphi. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step four - future proof your application</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although we don't anticipate that we will ever do such a complete
overhaul of the JVCL again, you still need to future proof your
applications so the next version of JVCL doesn't catch you by surprise.
Since almost all the duplicate components in JVCL have been merged,
there are not many that we think will change. But you should still
consider the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>If there is more than one component with the same basic name, you
can expect one of them to disappear in the future. For example, there
is a TJvTrayIcon and a TJvxTrayIcon component. One of them will most
likely disappear. To try to determine which one remain, compare their
feature sets and their functionality. The most feature rich and best
working component is probably be the one that will be kept. When two
components are merged and they have similar base names, the name best
matching JVCL naming standards will be used for the new component. For
example, in the example above a merged tray icon component would be
named TJvTrayIcon (and it's unit would be named JvTrayIcon.pas) even if
the main part of the implementation was taken from the original
TJvxTrayIcon/JvxTrayIcon.pas. </li>
  <li>Components in the deprecated list in readme.htm will probably not
be part of the next JVCL release. </li>
  <li>Very simple components and some JCL duplicate functions might not
be part of the next release. Currently, there is no list of functions
that might be moved to JCL or replaced by JCL equivalents. </li>
  <li>Donated component libraries will not likely be split up or merged
with the "main" JVCL library. So if you are using a component from the
Jans library, you can expect it to be available in the future even if
that component is an exact duplicate of another component in JVCL. The
same holds true the other way around: even if a component in JVCL is an
exact duplicate of a component in a separate library, it will most
likely not be removed. Currently, we have six libraries with components
that we consider as separate entities. The JvUIB components, Jans
components, the JvWizard components, the
ManagedThreads components and the JvTimeFramework components. The
Globus library is a separate case in JVCL 3.5 and is being merged into
the JVCL. Please read on for details.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Migrating from pre-JVCL donated libraries</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As well as providing a JVCLConvert file to update JVCL 2.10 code,
the JVCL distribution includes converter files for the various donated
libraries that have been adopted into JVCL. These are found in the
converter folder as shown:</p>

<h3>Migrating from&nbsp;RxLib to JVCL</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The converter\RxLib.dat and converter\RxToJVCLApp.dat files converts
between RxLib and JVCL2.10 and the resulting names might not be
compatible with the latest release. To fix this, first convert using
RxToJVCLApp.dat and then run again using converter\JVCL3.dat. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Migrating from Globus to JVCL 3.5<br>
</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The converter\Globus.dat file converts
between Globus and JVCL 3.00 initial release. However, as the Globus
components are being merged into the JVCL, the names and properties
change in a way that makes it almost impossible to use the converte.
Thus, please refer to the following <a href="migrating_globus.html">document</a>
where you will find a list of equivalent components and properties.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="ManualRep"></a>Manual component replacement</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some obsolete or changed components from JVCL 2.10 that are
not converted automatically by JVCLConvert, and must be dealt with
manually. The suggested basic techniques are intended to get you going
quickly, but you must check that they make sense in your own
circumstances. It is also <i>very</i> incomplete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that the following suggestions assume that, as suggested above,
you have converted all your DFM form files into text, so that they can
be edited with an ordinary text editor. You may find it easier to
change the DFMs outside the Delphi IDE using Notepad or your choice of
editor, only switching back to Delphi to check that the form file loads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>TJvIntegerEdit</h3>
<p>Search and replace TJvIntegerEdit with TJvValidateEdit in PAS and
DFM files, and delete JvTypedEdit from the Uses clause in the PAS.
Since TJvValidateEdit defaults to integer edits, this usually suffices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beware if the Value property of TJvIntegerEdit is read in by
TJvFormStorage. This fails (does nothing) silently. You can use the
Text property instead, but this leads to incompatibility with existing
INI files or Regsitry keys. A rather horrible workaround is to use the
Text property and implement an OnTranslatePropertyName to map the Text
property to the Value property. Note that this is being worked on and a
fix will be provided shortly.<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>TJVxCurrencyEdit</h3>
<p>Usually used as an Integer edit, therefore again replaced by
TJvValidateEdit. Search/Replace TJVxCurrencyEdit to TJvValidateEdit in
PAS and DFM files, then delete the DisplayFormat property of
TJVxCurrencyEdit controls in the DFM (if you don't, Delphi may throw an
AV attempting to load the form).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should allow you to load the form in the IDE - now check it
still does what you want. You should also set the DisplayFormat
property to dfCurrency.<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>TJvFormStorage</h3>
<p>TJvFormStorage's functionality has been split across multiple
components in JVCL. When you try to load a form with an old component,
Delphi may well complain about properties that no longer exist, such as
IniFilename and IniSection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you used TJvFormStorage to store settings in an INI file, drop an
TJvAppIniFileStorage on the form (from the JvPersistence tab), and set
the AppStorage property of your FormStorage to point to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> TJvAppIniFileStorage.FileName property replaces the old
IniFilename. If you supply a full path for the file
TJvAppIniFileStorage.Location should be set to flCustom to get the
component to use your path.<br>
If TJvAppIniFileStorage.Location is left at its default value flExeFile
then the file will be written in the .EXE's launch directory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TJvFormStorage.AppStoragePath replaces the old IniSection property.
Don't be fazed by the way it appends a backslash when you do it
interactively. This doesn't appear in the Section title. If the section
name is not significant, or is blank, leave it to default - it will use
the Form name, just like a blank IniSection of old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you used a FormStorage to use the Registry, instead drop a
TJvAppRegistryStorage onto the form instead. You may also decide to use
the XML component.<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>TJvTimerEvent</h3>
<p>Loading a JVCL 2.10 form containing a TJvTimerList into the Delphi
IDE, you will get an error that<br>
'TJvTimerEvent cannot be found'.</p>
<p>This is caused by a change in TJvTimerList's DFM format. The
simplest way to explain is with an example:</p>
<p><b>Old Format:</b></p>
<pre>  object tlMain: TJvTimerList<br>    Left = 376<br>    Top = 181<br>    object teFormVisible: TJvTimerEvent<br>      Cycled = False<br>      Enabled = False<br>      Interval = 1<br>      OnTimer = teFormVisibleTimer<br>    end<br>    object teDefaultRefresh: TJvTimerEvent<br>      OnTimer = teDefaultRefreshTimer<br>    end<br>    object teDelayedGridUpdate: TJvTimerEvent<br>      Enabled = False<br>      Interval = 0<br>      OnTimer = teDelayedGridUpdateTimer<br>    end<br>    object teDelayedCellEdit: TJvTimerEvent<br>      Enabled = False<br>      Interval = 0<br>      OnTimer = teDelayedCellEditTimer<br>    end<br>  end<br></pre>
<b>New Format: </b>
<pre>  object tlMain: TJvTimerList<br>    Events = &lt;<br>      item<br>        Name = 'teFormVisible'<br>        Cycled = False<br>        Enabled = False<br>        Interval = 1<br>        OnTimer = teFormVisibleTimer<br>      end<br>      item<br>        Name = 'teDefaultRefresh'<br>        OnTimer = teDefaultRefreshTimer<br>      end<br>      item<br>        Name = 'teDelayedGridUpdate'<br>        Enabled = False<br>        Interval = 0<br>        OnTimer = teDelayedGridUpdateTimer<br>      end<br>      item<br>        Name = 'teDelayedCellEdit'<br>        Enabled = False<br>        Interval = 0<br>        OnTimer = teDelayedCellEditTimer<br>      end&gt;<br>    Left = 376<br>    Top = 181<br>  end<br></pre>
<p>The simplest solution is just to edit the text from one format to
the other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that you also have to edit any code in the PAS file that refers
to the TTimerEvent directly. For example you have to change this code</p>
<pre> teDelayedCellEdit.Enabled := False;<br></pre>
<p>to this</p>
<pre> tlMain.Events.ItemByName('teDelayedCellEdit').Enabled := False;<br></pre>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
