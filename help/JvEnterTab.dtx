Summary
  A component to redirect all ENTER keys to TAB keys.
Description
  Use a TJvEnterAsTab component when you need to redirect ENTER
  keys to TAB keys.

  Many DOS programs use ENTER to move between the entry fields
  in the "form". Windows programs use the TAB character instead
  but many users still prefer using the ENTER key. Especially
  when working with the numeric keypad, using ENTER as TAB
  speeds up data entry manifold.
Note
  TJvEnterAsTab is actually a visual component (derived from
  TGraphicControl) but it behaves as a TComponent both at
  design as well as runtime. The reason for this is that by
  inheriting from a visual control, there is no need to create
  a hidden window to receive the key presses since this
  functionality is already built into visual controls.

@@TJvEnterAsTab.AllowDefault
Summary
  Specifies if the component should consider button controls.
Description
  Use AllowDefault to specify if button controls should process the ENTER key themselves. For example,
  when this property is true and the currently active control on the form is a button, the button will
  be clicked when the user presses ENTER. If this property is set to false, focus is moved to the next
  control instead.

@@TJvEnterAsTab.EnterAsTab
Summary

Description
  Set EnterAsTab to true to active the key redirection.

@@TJvEnterAsTab.SetBounds
Summary
  Sets the size of the control.
Description
  TJvEnterAsTab overrides the SetBounds method to restrict the size for the component so it appears to be a
  non-visual component. Specifically, width and height are never allowed to change from the default
  28 by 28 pixels.
