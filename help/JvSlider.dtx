  FLAG=Component
Summary
  Slider displayed with user-defined images.
Description
  TJvSlider represents a slider displayed with user-defined images.

  Use TJvSlider to display a slider control with your images. Set ImageRuler and ImageThumb to
  specify bitmaps that appear on the ruler and thumb, respectively.

  Use the events OnBeginChange, OnChanged and OnStopChanged to respond when the user changes the
  thumb position.

  Set Maximum to indicate an upper limit to the value that can be represented using the slider. Use
  Position to get the actual value the slider represents.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvSlider.AutoSize
Summary
  Determines whether the size of the slider control automatically resizes to accommodate the ruler
  image.
Description
  Use AutoSize to make the slider adjust its size automatically so the client area accommodates the
  height and width of the ruler image. When AutoSize is false, the slider is fixed in size. When
  AutoSize is true, the size of the slider readjusts whenever the ruler image changes.

  By default, AutoSize is true.

@@TJvSlider.Create
Summary
  Creates and initializes an instance of TJvSlider.
Description
  Call \Create to create an instance of TJvSlider at runtime. A TJvSlider component placed on a form
  at design time is created automatically.

  Pass a single Component as a parameter to provide the slider control with an Owner that is
  responsible for freeing it.

  \Create calls the inherited \Create method, then sets the initial values for the slider control as
  follows:

  * Maximum is set to 100.
  * Position is set to 0.
  * Horizontal is set to true.
  * The default images for the thumb and ruler are loaded.
Parameters
  AOwner - The owner for the instance of TJvSlider.

@@TJvSlider.Destroy
Summary
  Destroys an instance of TJvSlider.
Description
  Do not call Destroy directly in an application. Instead, call Free. Free verifies that the
  TJvSlider object is not nil and only then calls Destroy.

@@TJvSlider.Horizontal
Summary
  Indicates whether the slider is oriented vertically or horizontally.
Description
  Set Horizontal to true to orient the slider horizontally. Set Horizontal to false to orient the
  slider vertically.

@@TJvSlider.ImageRuler
Summary
  Specifies the bitmap that is used for the ruler background.
Description
  Use the Open dialog box that appears as an editor in the Object Inspector to choose a bitmap file
  (with a .BMP extension) to use as the background, or specify a TBitmap object at runtime.

  Use AutoSize to make the slider adjust its size automatically so the client area accommodates the
  height and width of the ruler image.

  TJvSlider.AutoSize, TJvSlider.ImageThumb

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvSlider.ImageThumb
Summary
  Specifies the bitmap that appears on the thumb.
Description
  Use the Open dialog box that appears as an editor in the Object Inspector to choose a bitmap file
  (with a .BMP extension) to use on the thumb, or specify a TBitmap object at runtime.

  You must provide two images within a single bitmap. Both images must be the same size and next to
  each other in a row. The slider displays one of these images depending on its state.
