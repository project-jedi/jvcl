@@IJvDataProvider
Summary
  Data Provider server interface.
Description
  IJvDataProvider is the main Data Provider interface. A component that is to function as a Data
  Provider should always support this interface.
  The interface provides methods that:
  * allows registration/unregistration of change notifications
  * allows retrieval of the root items list.
  * allows change notification (both before and after changing)
  * selection of current consumer/context
  * various administrative tasks (destruction of consumer, specification of consumer service
    extensions, allow provider designer and/or context manager).
  Although any component could function as a Data Provider, it's often wise to use the JVCL provided
  base classes (in the JvDataProvider unit) to write new Data Providers as these classes deal
  with most of the basics of the Data Provider mechanism so you can focus on writing the actual
  provider.

@@IJvDataProvider.RegisterChangeNotify
Summary
  Register a change notification callback interface.
Description
  RegisterChangeNotify is used to register a IJvDataProviderNotify interface. The methods of this
  interface are called in response to changes at the provider. Usually the IJvDataProviderNotify
  interface is handled by the consumer to update it's control as needed.
Parameters
  ANotify - Notification interface to register. If the specified reference is already registered,
            nothing will happen.

@@IJvDataProvider.GetItems
Summary
  Retrieves the list of root items.
Description
  GetItems retrieves the IJvDataItems instance containing the list of root items. Each Data Provider
  has to have an IJvDataItems instance so you can safely assume that GetItems will never return a
  nil reference.

  Note that it's common for the IJvDataProvider instance to support the IJvDataItems interface as
  well. This means that if dpvMe contains a reference to IJvDataProvider that:
<CODE>
  dpvMe.QueryInterface(IJvDataItems, disRoot)
</CODE>
  will be the same as:
<CODE>
  disRoot := dpvMe.GetItems

@@IJvDataProviderNotify
Summary
  Consumer interface to respond to changes at the provider.
Description
  IJvDataProviderNotify is consumer-side interface who's methods are called in response to changes
  at the provider.

  A consumer that wishes to be notified of changes occuring at the provider will register this
  reference at the provider by calling the provider's
  <LINK IJvDataProvider.RegisterChangeNotify, RegisterChangeNotify> method. If the consumer is no
  longer interested in changes at a provider (i.e. another provider is selected or the consumer is
  destroying), the <LINK IJvDataProvider.UnregisterChangeNotify, UnregisterChangeNotify> method
  should be called.

  Note that it's perfectly legal to register the same change notification for multiple providers. In
  all cases a registered callback should eventually be unregistered before this object is destroyed.
  The only exception is when a provider is destroying or has been destroyed; in that case the
  callback is implicitly unregistered.

@@IJvDataItems.GetItemByID
Summary
  Retrieve an item from the list given it's ID (or ID path).
Description
  GetItemByID retrieves a Data Item from the list given it's ID or ID-path. Each item will be
  initiated with an ID value which should be unique throughout the tree - although this is not
  enforced - and this method allows to retrieve an item given that ID.

  The path is always considered relative to this list. If the ID string starts with a backslash (or
  forwardslash; both are allowed), the path is considered from the root of the provider
  (GetProvider.GetItems).

  Each '..\' is considered as '1 level up the tree'.

  As soon as a term in the path can't be retrieved the entire result will be nil. This can happen
  when to many '..\' terms appear or one of the ID's in the path can't be found.
Parameters
  ID  - The ID or ID-path of the item to retrieve.

  Each integer in the array is considered to be an index into a list of items. The first integer
  refers to the IJvDataItems instance on which this method is called. If more index values follow,
  the item is queried for a IJvDataItems interface. If one is not found the end result will be nil,

Summary
  Support interface for IJvDataItems to specify image lists for the items.
Description
  IJvDataItemsImages is an optional supporting interface for IJvDataItems that allows to specify
  which image list is to be used for an item.

  The support interface is used whenever an Data Item supports IJvDataItemImage. Depending on the
  implementation of the rendering code, the IJvDataItemsImages must be supported in the direct list
  owner of an item or can be supported anywhere up the item tree.

  The interface provides three different image lists:
  * an image list for disabled state.
  * an image list for "hot" items.
  * a normal image list.

  The normal image list must be set. If an item is disabled but there's no disabled image list,
  the normal image will used but drawn in a grayed-out/disabled state.

  If an item is "hot" (e.g. the mouse hovers over it) but there's no "hot" image list, the normal
  image list will be used.

@@IJvDataItemsRenderer
Summary
  Support interface for IJvDataItems that handles rendering and measuring of it's items and their
  sub items.
Description
  IJvDataItemsRenderer is an optional supporting interface for IJvDataItems that can handle the
  rendering and measuring of the items in the list.

  The interface provides methods to:
  * Draw an item given it's index.
  * Measure an item given it's index.
  * Draw the specified IJvDataItem instance.
  * Measure the specified IJvDataItem instance.
  * Determine the average item size.

  Some implementations of this interface will first check if the item to render or measure supports
  the IJvDataItemRenderer interface; if it does, it will redirect the operation to that
  implementation instead of handling it itself.

  Consumers generally handle rendering/measuring in the following way:
  * Check if the item supports the IJvDataItemRenderer interface. If it does, use that one to
    perform the rendering/,easuring.
  * Check for the closest IJvDataItemsRenderer interface (the direct owning IJvDataItems list or
    any of the lists in it's parent chain). If it finds one, that one is used to perform the
    rendering/measuring.
  * Handle the rendering at the consumer side. This means all items are considered equal and usually
    only IJvDataItemText and optionally IJvDataItemImage (and the corresponding IJvDataItemsImages)
    are used. The entire rendering/measuing is then consumer (control) dependant and the provider
    tree may no longer look uniform in different consumers/clients.

  MeasureItemByIndex measures the item specified by the Index parameter. Depending on the
  implementation the method might first check if the item to measure supports the
  IJvDataItemRenderer interface; if it does, the measuring is handled by that interface instead.
Parameters
  ACanvas - Canvas to measure on. On entry to this method, it is assumed the canvas brush, pen and
            font are initialized to the proper values.
  Index -   Index into the items array of the item to measure.

Summary
  Data Item support interface for adding image support to an item.
Description
  IJvDataItemImage is a supporting interface for IJvDataItem that adds image support to an item. For
  this interface to be useful, some things have to be taken care of:
  * The IJvDataItems owner of the item (or any of the IJvDataItems owners in the parent chain) must
    support the IJvDataItemsImages interface and atleast have a valid image list assigned to it's
    <LINK IJvDataItemsImages.Images, Images> property.
  * The rendering code must be able to handle images. Rendering may be handled at the item itself
    (IJvDataItemRenderer supported by this item), by the item list owner of this item of any item in
    the parent chain (IJvDataItemsRenderer supported by an IJvDataItems implementation) or at the
    consumer (client control). The JEDI-VCL provides generic render implementations of which some
    do support image.

  The interface provides properties to manage:
  * The position of the image in relation to the caption
  * Which image to use in normal cases
  * which image to use when the item is selected/has focus.
