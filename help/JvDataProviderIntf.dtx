@@IJvDataConsumer
Summary
  Provider client interface.
Description
  IJvDataConsumer is the main provider client interface. It is implemented by all components and
  controls that are able to obtain their information from a Data Provider.

  The interface only provides two "administrative" methods: retrieve the VCL component the consumer
  interface belongs to and determine which Data Provider Attributes apply to this consumer.

  Consumer may support additional interfaces (commonly referred to as "Consumer Extensions") to support
  other settings.

  Data Providers are generally not concerned about the consumer that is using them. The only notable
  exception is the <LINK IJvDataProvider.ConsumerClasses, ConsumerClasses> method; this method will use
  the AttributeApplies method to determine which extensions are needed.

  Other cases when Data Providers are interested in the consumer are those providers that allow
  additional settings for each individual consumer (usually by providing a Provider specific Consumer
  Extension).

@@IJvDataConsumer.AttributeApplies
Summary
  Determines if an attribute applies to the consumer.
Description
  AttributeApplies determines if the specified attribute applies to the consumer. The method is
  primarily used by the <LINK IJvDataProvider, data provider>'s <LINK IJvDataProvider.ConsumerClasses,
  ConsumerClasses> method to build the list of consumer extensions.

  If an attribute applies the function should return True, otherwise False should be returned.

@@IJvDataConsumerClientNotify
Summary
  Data consumer support interface to be notified when another consumer changes item.
Description
  IJvDataConsumerClientNotify is a consumer support interface to be notified when another consumer
  changes item.

  The implementer of this interface is notified when an item gets selected at another consumer (the
  server) and when a link to it is added to or removed from a server.

  The IJvDataConsumerClientNotify always communicates with the IJvDataConsumerServerNotify of the
  server consumer to request itself being added to or removed from the server or to notify the server
  when the provider is changed (the server will then determine if the client is still allowed and
  optionally breaks the link if this is not the case).

  Linking of consumers can be used (for example) to link a context selection consumer (e.g. a combo box
  linked to a context provider) to a client consumer and have the context of that consumer updated
  automatically when the context selection consumer selects a different context. In this scheme,
  IJvDataConsumerClientNotify is used at the client consumer.

@@IJvDataConsumerContext
Summary
  Data consumer support interface to retrieve the selected context.
Description
  IJvDataConsumerContext is a consumer support interface to retrieve or specify the context of the
  consumer.

  Various providers use contexts to differentiate between various tree configurations and/or content.
  The IJvDataConsumerContext interface allows you to retrieve the current or specify a new context for
  this consumer.

  Providers rarely need to access this interface, since most of the time when a consumer is selected as
  the current one, its context is automatically selected as well. With <LINK
  IJvDataConsumerServerNotify, Server>/<LINK IJvDataConsumerClientNotify, Client> consumers, access to
  the this interface might be useful. The interface is also used by the design time editors.

@@IJvDataConsumerItemState
Summary
  Data consumer support interface to determine item states at the consumer side.
Description
  IJvDataConsumerItemState is a consumer support interface to retrieve Enabled, CHecked and/or Visible
  state of an item at the consumers side.

  When a provider or consumer support interface needs one of the afformentioned states, it will first
  request the state from the consumer (if it supports the IJvDataConsumerItemState interface). If this
  interface is not supported or if the returned state equals disNotUsed, the state is requested from
  the IJvDataItemStates interface of the item.

  Each of the states can be one of "False", "True", "Indetermined" or "Not used". The consumer is
  responsible of setting the appropiate rendering options based on these settings but is not required
  to handle them. In addition a consumer may override the setting of the item at its discretion.

@@IJvDataConsumerServerNotify
Summary
  Data consumer support interface to notify another consumer when the current item changes.
Description
  IJvDataConsumerServerNotify is a consumer support interface that allows other consumers (supporting
  the IJvDataConsumerClientNotify interface) to be linked and notified if the current item of this
  consumer changed.

  The implementer of this interface is notified when a client consumer changed its provider. You are
  responsible for checking if the client consumer is still valid and optionally break the link to the
  client if this is no longer the case. In addition you must keep a record of linked clients and notify
  them when the selected item changed or the client is removed (either because the client is no longer
  valid due to a provider change or because the server consumer is destroying).

  Linking of consumers can be used (for example) to link a context selection consumer (e.g. a combo box
  linked to a context provider) to a client consumer and have the context of that consumer updated
  automatically when the context selection consumer selects a different context. In this scheme,
  IJvDataConsumerServerNotify is used at the context selection consumer.

  implementations will check if the client is valid and not already linked before adding it.

  When the client is added, the <LINK IJvDataConsumerClientNotify.LinkAdded, LinkAdded> method of the
  client is called.
Parameters
  Client - Reference to the client consumer notification interface of the consumer to add.

@@IJvDataConsumerServerNotify.IsValidClient
Summary
  Checks if the client is a valid client to be linked to the server.
Description
  IsValidClient determines if the specified client consumer is a valid client to be linked to the
  server. If the client is valid the method returns True, otherwise False will be returned.

  Each server will have different criteria to determine if the client consumer can be linked. In the
  case of a context selection consumer, the server will make sure the client consumer is linked to the
  same provider as the context selection consumer's linked context provider is.

  Most implementers use this method in both the AddClient as well as the NotifyProviderChanged methods
  to determine validity of the client consumer.
Parameters
  Client - Reference to the client consumer notification interface of the consumer to check.

@@IJvDataConsumerServerNotify.NotifyProviderChanged
Summary
  Called by the client when it has changed provider or other setting that may influence the validity.
Description
  NotifyProviderChanged is called by a client consumer when it has changed to another provider or other
  setting that may influence the validity of the client. This allows the server to check if the client
  can remain linked to the server or not.

  Most implementers will first call IsValidClient to determine if the client consumer is still valid
  and if this is not the case will then call RemoveClient to break the link.

@@IJvDataConsumerViewList
Summary
  Data consumer support interface to manager the tree of data items in a flat list.
Description
  IJvDataConsumerViewList is a consumer support interface that manages the tree of data items in a flat
  list.

  Consumers that can render multiple items but only in a flat list will use this support interface to
  maintain a flat list representation of the tree and allow expand/collapse control of it.

  Implementers of this interface will have to handle changes at the provider (specifically the adding
  and removing of items) and update the view list accordingly. Also some changes at the consumer (such
  as context switching) may require updates in the view list or even complete rebuilds.

Summary
  Retrieve a reference to a child item of a given item.
Description
  SubItem retrieves a reference to the specified child item of the specified parent item. The two
  versions of this method allow to specify the parent either as a data item or as a 0-based index in
  the view list.

  If the parent item could not be found either an exception is raised or a nil pointer is returned
  (depends on the implementer).

  If the item has no children or the index is out of range either an exception is raised or a nil
  pointer is returned (depends on the implementer). Most implementers will choose to return a nil
  pointer in this case, as there's no real way to tell the number of child items an item has.
Parameters
  Parent - Either a reference to the parent item or a 0-based index in the view list of the parent
            item. Allowed values for the index version ranges from 0 to Count-1.

@@IJvDataContext
Summary
  Context object.
Description
  IJvDataContext represents an individual context. Contexts allow providers to represent their contents
  in a different way to different consumers.

  Each context can represent a different tree and/or different item properties while using the same
  data. This keeps the memory usage down, since the common information is kept only once.

  Consumers can select which context they want to use so multiple consumers with the same context will
  get the exact same representation.

  Contexts allow for inheriting the properties (or tree structure) of the parent context if such
  properties is not explicitly set for that context (this is at the discretion of the provider and some
  providers will not allow this behaviour or even allow contexts at a deeper level than the root). This
  also contributes to reducing memory usage. The IJvDataContextSensitive interface manages the
  inherited state of the properties.

  * The IJvDataItems owner of the item (or any of the IJvDataItems owners in the parent chain) must
    support the IJvDataItemsImages interface and atleast have a valid image list assigned to its <LINK

  * The rendering code must be able to handle images. Rendering may be handled at the item itself
    (IJvDataItemRenderer supported by this item), by the item list owner of this item of any item in
    the parent chain (IJvDataItemsRenderer supported by an IJvDataItems implementation) or at the
    consumer (client control). The JEDI-VCL provides generic render implementations of which some do
    support image.

  The interface provides properties to manage:

  * The position of the image in relation to the caption

Summary
  Data Item support interface that handles rendering and measuring itself.
Description
  IJvDataItemRenderer is a supporting interface for IJvDataItem that adds rendering and measuring
  capabilities to an item.

  Consumers generally handle rendering/measuring in the following way:

  * Check if the item supports the IJvDataItemRenderer interface. If it does use it to perform the
    rendering/measuring.
  * Check for the closest IJvDataItemsRenderer interface (the direct owning IJvDataItems list or any of

Summary
  List of IJvDataItem objects.
Description
  IJvDataItems represents the list of IJvDataItem objects. The interface is supported by
  IJvDataProvider and might be supported for individual IJvDataItem instances if a specific item
  contains sub items.

  The IJvDataItems interface provides methods that:

  * Allow retrieval of the number of items
  * All retrieval of an item based on its index, its ID (or ID-path) or an index path.
  * Determine the parent item that owns this list.
  * Determine the provider to which the item belongs.
  * Retrieve a reference to the TObject instance that implements this object.
  * Determine if the items are generated dynamically upon requesting them
  * Take action when a context is destroying.

Description
  GetItemByID retrieves a Data Item from the list given its ID or ID-path. Each item will be initiated
  with an ID value which should be unique throughout the tree - although this is not enforced - and
  this method allows to retrieve an item given that ID.

  The path is always considered relative to this list. If the ID string starts with a backslash (or

  Each '..' is considered as '1 level up the tree'.

  As soon as a term in the path can't be retrieved the entire result will be nil. This can happen when
  to many '..' terms appear or one of the ID's in the path can't be found.

  Support interface for IJvDataItems to specify image lists for the items.
Description
  IJvDataItemsImages is an optional supporting interface for IJvDataItems that allows to specify which

  The support interface is used whenever a Data Item supports IJvDataItemImage. Depending on the
  implementation of the rendering code, the IJvDataItemsImages must be supported in the direct list
  owner of an item or can be supported anywhere up the item tree.

  The interface provides three different image lists:

  * an image list for disabled state.
  * an image list for "hot" items.
  * a normal image list.

  The normal image list must be set. If an item is disabled but there's no disabled image list, the
  normal image will used but drawn in a grayed-out/disabled state.

  If an item is "hot" (e.g. the mouse hovers over it) but there's no "hot" image list, the normal image
  list will be used.

Description
  IJvDataItemsRenderer is an optional supporting interface for IJvDataItems that can handle the

  The interface provides methods to:

  * Draw an item given its index.
  * Measure an item given its index.
  * Draw the specified IJvDataItem instance.
  * Measure the specified IJvDataItem instance.
  * Determine the average item size.

  Some implementations of this interface will first check if the item to render or measure supports the
  IJvDataItemRenderer interface; if it does, it will redirect the operation to that implementation
  instead of handling it itself.

  Consumers generally handle rendering/measuring in the following way:

  * Check if the item supports the IJvDataItemRenderer interface. If it does use it to perform the
    rendering/measuring.
  * Check for the closest IJvDataItemsRenderer interface (the direct owning IJvDataItems list or any of
    the lists in its parent chain). If it finds one use it to perform the rendering/measuring.
  * Handle the rendering at the consumer side. This means all items are considered equal and usually

Summary
  Data Item support interface for keeping item states at the provider side.
Description
  IJvDataItemStates is a supporting interface for IJvDataItem that adds the capability of keeping the
  Enabled, Checked and Visible states for an item at the provider side.

  When a provider or consumer support interface needs one of the afformentioned states, it will first
  request the state from the consumer (if it supports the IJvDataConsumerItemState interface). If this
  interface is not supported or if the returned state equals disNotUsed, the state is requested from
  the IJvDataItemStates interface of the item.

  Each of the states can be one of "False", "True", "Indetermined" or "Not used". The consumer is
  responsible of setting the appropiate rendering options based on these settings but is not required
  to handle them. In addition a consumer may override the setting of the item at its discretion.

Summary
  Data Item support interface for retrieving the item's textual representation.
Description
  IJvDataItemText is a supporting interface for IJvDataItem that adds the capability of linking a
  caption for an item.

  Almost every provider support the IJvDataItemText interface for its items. Besides access to the
  caption, the interface also keeps track of the editability of the caption from the user interface.

@@IJvDataProvider
Summary
  Data Provider server interface.
Description
  IJvDataProvider is the main Data Provider interface. A component that is to function as a Data
  Provider should always support this interface. The interface provides methods that:

  * allows registration/unregistration of change notifications
  * allows retrieval of the root items list.
  * allows change notification (both before and after changing)
  * selection of current consumer/context
  * various administrative tasks (destruction of consumer, specification of consumer service
    extensions, allow provider designer and/or context manager).

  Although any component could function as a Data Provider, it's often wise to use the JVCL provided
  base classes (in the JvDataProvider unit) to write new Data Providers as these classes deal with most
  of the basics of the Data Provider mechanism so you can focus on writing the actual provider.

Description
  ConsumerDestroying is called whenever a consumer that used this provider is about to be destroyed.
  It's generally used to clean-up the selected consumer stack and making any reference to that consumer
  nil (it will not remove the references from the stack, as it might be possible a ReleaseConsumer call
  will follow it later).
Parameters
  Consumer - Consumer about to be destroyed.

Summary
  Called when a context is about to be destroyed.
Description
  ContextDestroying is called whenever a context is about to be destroyed. It's generally used to
  notify all items a specific context (and all of its child contexts) will be no longer available so
  context specific data for these items can be destroyed. Usually this will be done by redirecting the
  call to the root items list (GetItems). In addition ContextDestroying will clean up the selected
  context stack and nilling any reference to the context and/or any of its child contexts (they are not
  removed from the stack as a ReleaseContext may follow later).
Parameters
  Context - Context about to be destroyed.

Summary
  Reference to the implementing object.
Description
  GetImplementer returns a reference to the TObject instance implementing the IJvDataProvider

  interface. Callers should never assume a specific object unless it is enforced in the implementation
  of the caller.

@@IJvDataProvider.GetItems
Summary
  Retrieves the list of root items.
Description
  GetItems retrieves the IJvDataItems instance containing the list of root items. Each Data Provider
  has to have an IJvDataItems instance so you can safely assume that GetItems will never return a nil
  reference.

  Note that it's common for the IJvDataProvider instance to support the IJvDataItems interface as well.
  This means that if dpvMe contains a reference to IJvDataProvider that:
  <AUTOLINK OFF>
  <CODE>
  dpvMe.QueryInterface(IJvDataItems, disRoot) 
  </CODE>
  <AUTOLINK ON>

  will be the same as:

Summary
  Callback interface to respond to changes at the provider.
Description
  IJvDataProviderNotify is a callback interface who's methods are called in response to changes at the
  provider.

  An object that wishes to be notified of changes occuring at the provider will register this reference
  at the provider by calling the provider's <LINK IJvDataProvider.RegisterChangeNotify,
  RegisterChangeNotify> method. If the object is no longer interested in changes at a provider (i.e.
  another provider is selected or the object is destroying), the <LINK
  IJvDataProvider.UnregisterChangeNotify, UnregisterChangeNotify> method should be called.

  Note that it's perfectly legal to register the same change notification for multiple providers. In
  all cases a registered callback should eventually be unregistered before this object is destroyed.
  The only exception is when a provider is destroying or has been destroyed; in that case the callback
  is implicitly unregistered.
