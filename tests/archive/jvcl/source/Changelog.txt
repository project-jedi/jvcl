2003-06-17:
- New properties and procedures for TJvTreeView:
  * ItemHeight:integer - sets the pixel height of the items. If you try to set ItemHeight <= 0, it will currently restore the default height (which is 16px) 
  * LineColor:TColor - sets the color of the lines connecting nodes as well as the frame around the '+' and '-' buttons. Color of '+' and '-' is controlled by Font.Color. To assign same color to lines as to text, set LineColor to clDefault. 
  * InsertMarkColor:TColor - sets the color of the insertion marker (see InsertMark below). Use clDefault to set to same color as the font 
  * MaxScrollTime:integer - the maximum time a scroll should take in ms 
  * UseUnicode:boolean - determines if the control uses the Unicode character set. Only use on Win95/98 with IE5 or above installed 
  * procedure InsertMark(Node:TTreeNode;MarkAfter:boolean); 
    Shows an insertion mark at Node, either above or below depending on MarkAfter. If Node is nil, works like RemoveMark 
  * procedure RemoveMark; 
  Removes the insertion mark if visible

2003-06-15:
====================
- Cleaned and updated JvTypes.pas: several event types, enumerations and sets were renamed/removed. Some of the removed types are only used by units in \archive. These have been commented out and a reference to the using unit has been added. A complete list of changes are below. You can also get the JvTypesRename030615.dat file from CVS (it's in the jvcl\convert folder) and run your project through JVCLConvert using it.

NOTE: even if you run the dat file with JVCLConvert, you will still have to change any occurence of TJvAnimations -> TJvAnimation and TJvAnimation -> TJvAnimations manually.

    instead of typing a strange symbol.
    [SHIFT][BACKSPACE] acts like [BACKSPACE]
JvHLEditor.pas:
  {$DEFINE HL_NOT_QUITE_C}  { enable a nqc (LEGO MindStorm(R)) highlighter }
  {$DEFINE BUGFIX} { some bugfixes }

2002-12-24

- Made TJvCustomCheckedMaskEdit a descendant of TJvCustomMaskEdit
- Streamlined the focus change event interfaces in TJvCustomMaskEdit and descendants and related compos:
  [ATTENTION! Streaming Interface change!]
  Renamed events  OnLoseFocus > OnKillFocus
                  OnGetFocus  > OnSetFocus

2002-11-04
- As has been discussed on the NG in mid-October, decoupled TJvCustomMonthCalendar from its appearance properties for the benefit of TJvDatePickerEdit which could now expose all the relevant appearance-related properties of its dropdown calendar while still retaining its create-on-demand model without having to manage duplicated data. At this stage the designtime interface of TJvMonthCalendar2 remains completely intact. In the future it might be considered to drop the individual appearance-related properties in favour of exposing the Appearance instance directly. //ogiesen

2002-11-02
- Added TStrings item editor to JvInspector //marcelb

2002-11-01
- Added JvWndProcHook unit. This unit implements a method of safe subclassing of the WndProc of any TControl and makes sure the WndProc link can't be broken. Also modified JvHook, JvButtons, JvCaptionButton, JvaCaptionButton, JvAppHotKey, JvDragDrop, JvEasterEgg, JvPlacemnt, JvMagnet, Jvgrdcpt to use JvWndProcHook instead if subclassing directly. Moved JvHooks to \Archive. Moved TJvWindowHook class from JvHook to JvWndProcHook and modified it to use the JvWndProc subclassing method.  //peter3, remkobonte

2002-10-27

Affected units are JvEditor, JvHLPareser, JvRegAuto, JvRegAutoEditor, JvStrUtil, JvUtils, JvaScrollText and JvDBUtil // peter3
- Changed comment style of the first comment (license and author info) in JvHIDControllerClass, JvInspDB, JvInspXVCL, JvObjSel to make it easier to parse with the JVCL 3 admin tool //peter3

2002-10-15

- Added OnItemValueChanged/OnDataValueChanged events to TJvCustomInspector //marcelb
