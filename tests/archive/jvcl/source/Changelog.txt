- Modifications from Andreas Hausladen:
==============================================================================
Theses modifications were primary applied to the R&A Library 2.00 in order to
make the highlighter editor RAHLEditor (now JvHLEditor) more acting like the
Delphi Editor.

JvStrUtils.pas
  {$DEFINE BUGFIX}
  * Bugfix: function GetXYByPos counts #13 instead of #10
JvHLParser.pas:
  {$DEFINE BUGFIX}
  * Bugfix: In CBuilder mode a string like "abc\\" will not terminate the string
    token, corrected
JvEditor.pas:
  {$DEFINE RAEDITOR_MORE_DELPHI_LIKE}
  {$DEFINE RAEDITOR_SPEED_FASTDRAW}
  {$DEFINE RAEDITOR_SPEED_FONTCACHE}

  + Added OnCommand2 event to TKeyboard for special two key shortcuts like
    [CTRL][Q]+[F]

    instead of typing a strange symbol.
    [SHIFT][BACKSPACE] acts like [BACKSPACE]
JvHLEditor.pas:
  {$DEFINE HL_NOT_QUITE_C}  { enable a nqc (LEGO MindStorm(R)) highlighter }
  {$DEFINE BUGFIX} { some bugfixes }

  * Bugfix: SetBlockColor raise an exception (AV) if iEnd becomes greater than
    MAX_X, corrected

- Added IFDEF JVCL_REGISTER_GLOBAL_DESIGNEDITORS check to registration units to conditionally register property and component editors that overrides default editors for non-JVCL components or for standard properties. The define is in JVCL.INC and it is disabled by default. To enable, remove the dot (.) in the define // peter3

2002-12-24
- Properly separated a TJvCustomMaskEdit out of TJvMaskEdit at last
- Made TJvCustomCheckedMaskEdit a descendant of TJvCustomMaskEdit
- Streamlined the focus change event interfaces in TJvCustomMaskEdit and descendants and related compos:
  [ATTENTION! Streaming Interface change!]
  Renamed events  OnLoseFocus > OnKillFocus
                  OnGetFocus  > OnSetFocus
  Renamed methods LoseFocus   > DoKillFocus
                  GetFocus    > DoSetFocus

- Moved JvTextContainer to \archive: duplicates TJvStrHolder with less functionality // peter3

2002-11-04
- As has been discussed on the NG in mid-October, decoupled TJvCustomMonthCalendar from its appearance properties for the benefit of TJvDatePickerEdit which could now expose all the relevant appearance-related properties of its dropdown calendar while still retaining its create-on-demand model without having to manage duplicated data. At this stage the designtime interface of TJvMonthCalendar2 remains completely intact. In the future it might be considered to drop the individual appearance-related properties in favour of exposing the Appearance instance directly. //ogiesen

2002-11-02
- Added TStrings item editor to JvInspector //marcelb

2002-11-01
- Added JvWndProcHook unit. This unit implements a method of safe subclassing of the WndProc of any TControl and makes sure the WndProc link can't be broken. Also modified JvHook, JvButtons, JvCaptionButton, JvaCaptionButton, JvAppHotKey, JvDragDrop, JvEasterEgg, JvPlacemnt, JvMagnet, Jvgrdcpt to use JvWndProcHook instead if subclassing directly. Moved JvHooks to \Archive. Moved TJvWindowHook class from JvHook to JvWndProcHook and modified it to use the JvWndProc subclassing method.  //peter3, remkobonte

2002-10-28
- Added JvScheduledEvents, ScheduleEditor. NOTE: needs JCL 1.22 or above // marcelb

2002-10-27

Affected units are JvEditor, JvHLPareser, JvRegAuto, JvRegAutoEditor, JvStrUtil, JvUtils, JvaScrollText and JvDBUtil // peter3
- Changed comment style of the first comment (license and author info) in JvHIDControllerClass, JvInspDB, JvInspXVCL, JvObjSel to make it easier to parse with the JVCL 3 admin tool //peter3

2002-10-15
